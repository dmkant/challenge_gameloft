US	3	2023-02-27	7.2.0	SleepySeas	Not bad, but not great	"Admittedly, this is one of the few games I’ve downloaded recently that I’ve felt like playing for more than a couple of hours. I haven’t felt the need to buy anything yet, and I’ve never seen any scummy or gross ads for the game yet. However, there are a few problems I have with it that I think should really be brought up:
1. Too many icons/popups. The UI just feels unnecessarily cluttered. I’m playing on a tablet, and it still feels like the buttons take up a frustrating amount of space. I’d personally make all the icons next to the main shop one button that opens up a menu, decrease the space the limited-time event icons on the top left take up, and find something to combine the social, storage, and dragonpedia (is that the name of the book icon? I don’t even use it) with. Also, give the option to disable popups like “you have a new dragon type!” or “you can build a new farm!” and the many event notifications, at least for a day. They kind of get on my nerves, especially when I can’t even hatch the new dragon or build the new structure it’s telling me about.
2. Too many ads. It wasn’t so bad at first, but I feel like you get random ads all the time, even if you just accidentally click on a menu and need to get out. Just lower the amount of random ads, and make it possible to watch ads to at least half every task’s time instead of it being random for you to even get the option.
3. Too little space at first. With level ups coming fairly quickly, and the game nudging you towards breeding as many dragons as you can, there’s not enough space for everything you’re expected to build. Even after unlocking a second island, it just feels cramped. Unfortunately, unlike the other two, I don’t really think there’s an easy way to fix this."

US	2	2023-02-27		Momnewbie	Fun if you don’t mind a million ads for every part of the game	My kids play this on their fire tablets - it’s great. I put it on my phone and it’s laden with ads and everything seems to “cost real money”
US	2	2023-02-25	7.2.0	idk7363	overpriced	idk
US	5	2023-02-24	7.2.0	smoochypoo	Great game	DML is amazing, there is always something to do and one of the games that is always fun to play, ALTHOUGH, prices are a little bit higher for basic things like 90k to remove tree plus like a 1hr wait? Not a big fan of that but overall 10/10
US	1	2023-02-21	7.2.0	Loganothechamp	Not as good as original	This is way to animated compared to the original dragon mania. The old one was absolutely fantastic, I’m deeply saddened to see that it’s not on any AppStore anymore. There’s to many dragons now with to many types. Please relaunch the old game :(
US	3	2023-02-20	7.2.0	SleepySeas	Like Dragon City, but less interesting	"I remember playing Dragon City when I was a kid, so when I heard that there was another game like it I was pretty interested. And maybe it’s the nostalgia talking, but this just… doesn’t feel right. There’s so many things asking for your money, and so much being thrown at you at once. The UI is so cluttered, with all the stores and event content. Not to mention the starting space is so cramped with how much they want you to build. I just couldn’t get into it.

EDIT: I actually went to play the other game I mentioned again, to see if it was actually better or I was just nostalgic, and no. It’s not better. They’re both mid, but there’s still something so disappointing about this game in particular."
US	5	2023-02-20	7.2.0	Angelmare	Cool game	So, I really like the game because it very creative and magical.super cool check it out .
US	5	2023-02-15	7.2.0	CoD Fan47	Great graphics, fun game	How do you destroy a game in one update?? Release a game without testing it. I hope it is fixed. This has been my go to game the last couple of years. It is the same old story with all the other games I play…I get a Bigger, better dragon, but the bad guys get a even bigger and even meaner dragon. That how it all goes. Great art work and great dragons. Most of the events are fun to play, best if you are in a clan.
US	1	2023-02-15	7.2.0	Acts 2:38 KJV	Disgusting Ads	Too many ads. Ads are too long. Keep your woke agenda out of the ads, there are kids playing this game. Now I’m deleting it!!!!

US	5	2023-02-12	7.2.0	Trenton Parson	Great game! But there is something I wanna say about it, that I do kind of hate about it	This game is a great dragon raising game! However, there is one thing that has always bothered me about it, and I know  to most people they would not care that much about this. But I wish your dragons could either grow more than once, and become even larger, or slowly get bigger as they level up! That’s some thing that games, like dragon city, or dragons world have that this one does not! Other than that this is a wonderful game!

US	3	2023-02-09	7.2.0	Acts 2:38 KJV	TOO MANY ADS	There are too many ads &amp; then you have to wait sometimes 30 seconds more before having to wait another 5 seconds. And it’s the same ads over &amp; over…It’s very annoying. I know they want you to buy stuff, but people who won’t spend money on these games aren’t going to change their mind, but might choose to delete it instead. I only play because my friends kid wanted a friend to play it with her. I hope these ads dwindle as time invested increases. Then there’s the fact that 99% are ads for other games. I think we all know how to go to the App Store &amp; search for the type of games we like. I prefer the Swiffer type ads. At least those ads might get me to purchase their product.

US	4	2023-02-07	7.2.0	m0nst3r.add1ct	I loved this game	I loved this game a few years ago, I connected it to my Facebook so I would have my progress saved bc I had all these different cool dragons, I was a high level, and I changed phones and ever since then, I logged into my Facebook account I connected it to and all my progress is gone. It’s sad, I miss playing this game, but I don’t know why it’s not giving me my progress back :[
US	3	2023-02-06	7.2.0	DemonLlama 🦙🦙🦙🦙	Fun game with problems	There is so much to do in this game and it can be really fun at times, even though it’s hard to play it for more than 20 minutes at a time. Unless you spend huge amounts of money there is hardly any playtime at all. The game is very pay to win. It wants you to spend giant amounts of real money that some players don’t have. If you don’t spend all that money than the game is really difficult and frustrating. Another problem is the ads. It’s a free game, of course it’s going to have ads, but there shouldn’t be an ad pop up every 2 minutes. Especially when those ads will crash my iPad (it’s a good, new iPad, shouldn’t be crashing) or they will take me to the AppStore without me pressing anything. It seems like the X will alway take me right to the AppStore. The only way I have found to get out of the ads is to close the window.  Not only can you hardly play at all without playing, half the time you can play is taken up by ads
US	1	2023-02-06	7.2.0	SeniorEscuela	REFUND	Workin with these guys for a refund is the most confusing thing possible, it’s almost like they push you in other directions to AVOID helping in advance with getting a refund. They always AND ALWAYS mess up pricing in game, there’s been many times I bought an item for let’s say $24.99 and it says OH ITS HALF OFF, so the original price is marked out, let’s say the original price was $49.99, that gets marked out and replaced with 24.99, but as soon as you buy it you get charged 49.99+ tax, they do this ALL the time, been many times I’ve bought $14.99 charged $35+ and it keeps happening, I’m done buying from these guys because they won’t even help, they just tel you to contact ITunes like iTunes has a say in it… since when did iTunes do service for app purchases in game?
US	5	2023-02-03	7.2.0	dodo dodo do do do	Awesome	"I’m not trying to be obsessed but I have 5 siblings and all of us sit on the couch together playing dragon ml (even my 3 year old sister) I love that there’s always new events and dragons. I love showing of to my siblings all the new dragons I get I also love that I can be friends with my siblings and send them gifts it’s an awesome game and also a fun game but 

The one thing I don’t like is that lets say my sister is on a tablet I’m on a iPad my brothers on a computer then we can’t be friends but if we’re all on the same type of device then we can but since that’s it it’s still a great game and I would really recommend it to anyone oh and also I can’t change my name and I used to be baby shark but I gave my tablet to my brother and play on my iPad so I really really want to change my name 

By: baby shark
Ps (my name in dragon ml)

Pps:what dose ps mean"
US	5	2023-02-02	7.2.0	Spring ✨	Cute Game!	"I really like this game, it is a bit “oooh money please oOooo” but the designs of the dragons are appealing and overall a cute game, I like the elements and stuff I wish the time for hatching and breeding was shorter, and im new so it probably gets longer and I don’t want to spend money for a extra den. But theres one thing I wanna say, I think i found an cute easter egg its sigil battle 18 “Memories of mom”  
I don’t know if its a consequence or not but the hornbill and the pansy flower (the dragons name) represent everlasting love and purity. Which is really sweet if connected with the title :)"
US	5	2023-01-31	7.2.0	Good but give warnings	Good game but give warnings	"So pretty solid game overall but the thing is when you get a lot of gems and you do a certain event some people see the dragon, and just battle until they get it, but it cost diamonds/gems so they waste all of their gems. That’s why they 
should give warnings that it cost gems"
US	5	2023-01-29	7.2.0	applejackcutie2	Good	This the best game ever
US	4	2023-01-26	7.2.0	Àfę	Arena unfairness??	Overall it’s a good game the waiting time can get very long and other small things like but that the main problem is the arena not the function of it but in the rare instance where there’s a tie all the opponents dragons are down and yours are all down to instead of the game dealing a tie breaker or just giving you the win they make you lose and if you want a second chance you have to pay 8 gems so all your dragons can come back only for you to win the match because all your opponents dragons you’ve already defeated I think the developers can handle this way better by either dealing a tie breaker match or just letting you win automatically
US	4	2023-01-25	7.2.0	53244262bobby	Great game, but there are a few issues…	Im a level 82 and have been playing DML since it came out, and I love it a lot. The wait times are pretty long, but i guess it makes sense and keeps players coming back. What I do NOT get is the dungeon and events. Literally, it takes me at least 4 days of constantly playing to even reach the treasure chest where you THINK the dragon will be there waiting for you…but no. You must open it 15 different times and spend like a million stepping stones to be able to get the dragon. The most I have  EVER got without paying before the event was over was like 2/15 times. The point is, why offer a dragon as a reward when it is impossible to get them without paying? Also, some events, not all, but some, are way too difficult. You cannot get like 1/2 of the event dragons without paying, even when you play constantly. I just don’t get it. Some event dragons are pretty easy to get though, like the sixth, seventh, and quartern dragons, so that’s cool. Also, I do NOT get the new arena. I don’t like how I spend a bunch of my hard earned gems just to keep refreshing to get a battle that I can actually win but I can’t because they are all too difficult. But, I still refresh and revive and spend my gems and fight to get those trophies. Oh wait! When the season is over, I get demoted to a lower league that I spent a bunch of gems to get out of and lose 1100 trophies that I spent my gems on to attain. WHY. I don’t like how arena leagues are judged on by your top dragons when the seasons over. It should be by how many battles you fight and win. Even though i have my issues, I really do love this game though. I like the uniqueness of each dragon and how you get to assemble your own team. I like sigils and enchanting and all that stuff. (The events where you find amulets and treasure on a map causes my device to crash a lot though) I don’t know it that’s because of my device or the game but i though I should mention it. 8/10

US	1	2023-01-19	7.2.0	AngelinaW1029	Way too pay to win.	This game was fun a few years ago, but this game has become unbelievably boring and money leaching over time. I guarantee you, almost every event that is distributed in this game requires some kind of money spent to actually get what the player wants. Ancient events are boring, repetitive, and are time consuming. If a player wants an ancient from an event, every six hours they would need to log in, assuming they have pretty averaged luck. GameLoft does not care about customer complaints, their responses being consistent of, “We’re sorry to hear that.” Something along the lines. No thanks.
US	5	2023-01-18	7.2.0	MChackerCreeper	Fun game	"This game is one of the best game I’ve played! 👍

US	3	2023-01-16	7.2.0	Meakee98	Love it but	My daughter loves this game. She could play it all day long. I would give it 5 stars but we are unable to change my daughters ID name. I also wish there was an “are you sure you want to sell option” button. My daughter has accidentally sold a few that we have paid for after hatching them. She is devastated when it happens.
US	2	2023-01-13	7.2.0	Ands231	Not like the ads	Am I missing something? Cuz it is not like the ads. in the ads you take a pics and then there is a dragon themed after the pics so I got the app and so far no option to to take photos and get dragons from them. What am I missing?
US	5	2023-01-12	7.2.0	Mandycandy420	Pricing	I’ve been playing this game roughly 2 years the only thing that should change is the price for the extra gems and games and shovels the other dragon game a play the prices are literally half of what this one charges
US	2	2023-01-11	7.2.0	EY2003	Too many ads	Game is fine for my kids. But too many commercials, as crazy as getting 2 ads in a minute and sometimes you cannot even close it out. Ridiculous.
US	1	2023-01-10	7.2.0	Sunrisetec	I’ve learned to hate this game	"I have played this game for years.  Used to love it.  Now I hate it.

Over the years they have increased the ads.

Now it has reached the intolerable point.  The ads pop up and you can’t  get rid of them.  You have to tap so many times it’s so bad.

I just exit the game and restart.

I guess they are getting ready to discontinue, since they don’t seem to care about the playability anymore."

US	4	2023-01-02	7.1.0	PandaProper	Fun game but missing a simple feature for parents!	My children loved this game on their Amazon Kindles, but recently  they received new Android tablets, and it’s but a massive pain in the neck to get the accounts transferred over. I have both tablets using my Google Play account so I can have parental control over both of them. Apparently, it’s not possible to have two player accounts on the same Google Play profile (which is fine), but even when they’re connect to separate Facebook accounts? That doesn’t make sense to me.

I’m fine when there is a choice to view them, like to get card packs, but when I’m just playing and an ad comes up that closes the game it makes it impossible and annoying to play. I hope y’all will fix this as the game has become entirely impossible to even play.

US	1	2022-12-12	7.1.0	Dragonking001	Wasted time	"Been playing for years only to see the game go from a 4 star to less then 1, if I could give less then 1 I would, events have become cash grab to even if you play every single day and miss no resets. You spent the entire time getting close to the end only to get nothing. Causing the game to become more money hungry. Dungeon is so terrible and it’s the main way to get event currency for awhile. I used to get so much stuff and enjoy the game. Now it just scraps for nothing and has not been enjoyable. Just a waste of time.

As the new tyrant event shows this game company is more desperate for money then players. After years of time playing I am tired of the scummy tactics. Stealing event currency and tickets when a “new stage” starts is a terrible way to keep players going and playing your game. Your game is NOT designed for free to play anymore."

US	1	2022-12-09	7.1.0	Little Fireball	Go woke? Go broke! LGBT Propaganda in a children’s game? Goodbye!	"Just deleted this game forever. I’ve been playing DML since it was first released... Veteran player, now retiring from this tripe... It was fantastic when it was first released about 8 years ago, but I gradually saw how this game declined over the years with greed. Only pay-to-win players can progress.

NOW: I see the devs have been brainwashed into the Woke Agenda by finally making the Arya character a lesbian, forcing you to read this unnecessary drama in which she tells the player about her new “girlfriend”... What??? What are you doing? That is just ridiculous... We didn’t need sexual propaganda, straight or “LGBT”, in this game that used to be simply about collecting and training cute dragons... This is a game for *children*... If you want to add sexual propaganda into this game, be honest and change the age rating to 18+, but don’t ruin a good kids’ game with the far-left Woke agenda. We just want to collect dragons, not watch a boring woke drama about two young girls sexually attracted to each other! I am a woman, and I find this highly unnecessary and forced - just shoehorned in with the latest update. What, did Disney take over? You do know they’re utterly failing and losing fans and money by shoving sexuality (an adult subject) into their movies and cartoons, right? 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

Deleted forever...... I will NEVER play DML again, nor will I support a company that is for brainwashing and sexualizing young children (like Disney and so many others in these dark days). Very sad, but I did see the little hints with Arya and I had a bad feeling... This is not necessary at all.... Just wow... Stupid move... 

Not only that, but this game’s theme was always an obvious cheap ripoff of How To Train Your Dragon, and I began to hate the game well over a year ago for the reason that the devs got sickeningly greedy, and pretty soon I couldn’t even progress to the next levels to get new habitats or expand my current ones to hold new bred/hatch dragons unless I spent money. I refused to participate in these tedious “events” for new OP dragons, as they were only obtainable for those who dumped unholy amounts of cash into the game. P2W game. Not worth it at all, especially when all the devs do is re-skin the same dragon models over and over. Greed, no creativity whatsoever, tedium, and now a lustful drama in the game... No thanks. 

Goodbye, DML. Won’t be missing this pathetic game. 🙄"

US	3	2022-12-07	7.1.0	U SUS BRO-	Good game but...	all I have to say is the prices. If you&#39;re a ftp player, don&#39;t read this. The prices to do absolutely anything at all in this game are horrifying. The monthly subscriptions. The 24hr+ wait times and 10$ skips to get the most common starter dragon. The 100$ for ONE dragon. The weekly, new, super-rare dragons that are impossible to get without purchases. The extreme list of things you can do with spending money, and the teeeny-tinyyy list of things you can do as a ftp-er. The gameplay is fun, addicting, and I developed deep emotional bonds with some dragons, but the prices made me quit after spending 1,000$ + usd. Good luck to any ftp-er&#39;s.

If I could send this review with zero stars I would, You ruined this game, you might get more people who are caught in the trap nowadays but your game is stupid.
US	4	2022-12-04	7.1.0	Puppies ccl	Awesome game	Amazing game but I wish that there weren’t random adds when your on your island.
US	5	2022-12-04	7.1.0	My writing 👌	❤️‍🔥best game ever	This game is the best I love how there is many dragons and they never run out I also love that this game is not boring. Every now and then there is a cool event take my advise and download it.
US	1	2022-12-03	7.1.0	Haley 🐋	Can’t Connect to Facebook	While I do love this game, I am not able to connect to Facebook. I recently got a new phone and I downloaded the game again. Everything works fine but when I try to connect to Facebook it does not work. I miss my old account. :(
US	4	2022-12-02	7.1.0	shrimp the raptor	Was the plan to make a zoo?	I really do love this game.though It’s more like a zoo than a village.
US	4	2022-12-01	7.1.0	my animal world	I love it😀👍🏾	Great job.
US	5	2022-11-29	7.1.0	Chengxi Tan	Childhood memories	This game is now in my childhood memories I remember lovingplaying  this game for a couple hours. I usually don’t stop until I run out of energy. If I wasn’t I would be in a constant addiction. This game is one of the first dragon based game I played and it was definitely worth it.
US	1	2022-11-27	7.0.2	LittlePipitPup	PLEASE FIX THE VIDEO PROBLEM!	Please!
US	2	2022-11-27	7.0.2	CeUNexTuesday	Forced adds	Seriously disappointed, liked the game and the ease to play, but getting a forced add after waiting 30 min for my food to be collected is not cool bro.
US	4	2022-11-27	7.0.2	serious right neow	Ads	I enjoy playing the game but the only thing I don’t like is the ads, I used to play this game a while ago and idk if I’m remembering wrong but it didn’t have ads only if you wanted extra rewards or something. It’s not that many ads but I hate ads so much it annoys me, but either way good game I recommend
US	2	2022-11-26	7.0.2	🐺forever	Disrespectful	"It’s an ok game and all, but the “tribal dragon” is pretty racist! I feel like you guys shouldn’t go around making races into dragons! Not to mention the pilgrim dragon, WE SHOULD NOT EVEN CELEBRATE PILGRIMS ON THANKSGIVING.
It is not fair to celebrate Columbus when he was not even smart enough to know what was India and what was not.
Thanksgiving is a holiday founded on the dead bodies of intelligent people who lived here in America longer than many of us know.
On thanksgiving, I celebrate the Indigenous people, and the feats they have conquered.
And all I can do is support and advocate for what is right."
US	4	2022-11-26	7.0.2	anime is life	Ad videos	This game is really fun but recently I’ve not really cared for the interactive video ads and lately whenever I’ve tried to play an ad video to get a gem or do a 30 minute time skip the ad video wouldn’t load and in order to continue playing I had to close the game and reopen it
US	5	2022-11-25	7.0.2	newton 1945	Issue with app loading icon	"Every time I click on watch video to get a gem or reward or anything else on the app the loading icon just shows up on the screen and stays there permanently. Please fix , I really like this game.
Thank you newspaper’s 1945"
US	2	2022-11-25	7.0.2	GayBoi95	Ads	The game is fun but you cant even breathe without getting an ad. Every time i tried to do something i got an ad. All they want is money.

Playing I was 5 and now I’m older and still play it it is for all ages and it is so entertaining. But it has soooooo much space being used in your phone and I hate that but everything else amazing"

US	5	2022-11-19	7.0.2	Paradgie	very fun	I spend lots of time on this and there are endless amounts of friends and dragons to make! And, clans can make that enjoyment even better. In this claim, i’m saying that this game is really good and that I recommend playing it if you have not downloaded it yet. Its just endless hours of fun and enjoyment.
US	3	2022-11-18	7.0.2	private name bo one can know	Fun but annoying ads	It is a pretty fun game but it is just another game following a really common style. Other than that the main reason for my rating is because they semi recently added forced ads into the game. The ads are rather short but it is still annoying having to watch a forced ad.
US	4	2022-11-18	7.0.2	JXycle	Can you guys remove ads?	I’ve been obsessed with this game for a few years because I loved it in my childhood and it had no ads at all at that time. I recently got it again to see what’s different about it and to relive the nostalgia and I come back to a bunch of ads. Some of them glitch and cause my game to stop working. I constantly have to close and reopen the app because the ads keep disrupting my game. Otherwise, it’s a great game and everything else is fine. Thank you.
US	5	2022-11-15	7.0.2	theflyingchikin (lol)	Server offline	"When I try to play it keeps telling me that the server is offline 
“Unable to reach dragolandia. Sorry, the servers are currently down! We’re working as fast as possible to remedy the situation.”"
US	3	2022-11-15	7.0.2	ghtyhfb	Too Many Ads	This game is very fun and i’ve recently started to get back into it, i like the way things have changed but there are so many ads, I feel like i only get to do a couple things before i run into a non skipable ad, game is fun but way to many ads
US	2	2022-11-13	7.0.2	dragonlovestacos	I lost all my progress!	I really enjoy this game, I don’t really have any problems with it, BUT i stopped playing this game for like a year or something so I decided to check on it and WOW ALL MY PROGRESS IS GONE AND IM GOING THROUGH THE TUTORIAL AGAIN 👏 I don’t know how to get my progress back and I don’t know what my other account was

US	1	2022-11-09	7.0.2	paramedicmelissa	Just ok	An ok game. Extremely difficult to advance in the game unless you pay lots of $$$$.
US	5	2022-11-07	7.0.2	the monster king.	THIS IS THE BEST!!!	hello! almost everything is amazing! the only thing that is wrong is that I can’t give myself a player name.😕
US	1	2022-11-07	7.0.2	Dragonking001	Wasted time	Been playing for years only to see the game go from a 4 star to less then 1, if I could give less then 1 I would, events have become cash grab to even if you play every single day and miss no resets. You spent the entire time getting close to the end only to get nothing. Causing the game to become more money hungry. Dungeon is so terrible and it’s the main way to get event currency for awhile. I used to get so much stuff and enjoy the game. Now it just scraps for nothing and has not been enjoyable. Just a waste of time.
US	3	2022-11-05	7.0.2	puppy and dragon fan	Really?	This is a knockoff of dragon city. But I got to say, the graphics are ok. It’s a little original. But mostly just a ripoff. Maybe make something a little more original? The thing that makes me know instantly it’s an knockoff is the name. Dragon mania legends? Just try something more original next time please. But it’s better than the ripoff I saw of seven eleven called seven twelve. So congratulations making it not THAT bad.
US	1	2022-11-04	7.0.2	hhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaahhh	Review	4 years ago this was the best game now you cannot go five minutes without seeing ads. Disappointed.

US	3	2022-10-05	7.0.0	opalhead	Crashed 3 times already today	It’s a fun game, love combining different dragons and battling but it won’t stop crashing and it really pushes you to “pay to play”. I deleted it because I’m not gonna get excited about a game when it won’t stop crashing. (My I phone is updated, and I restarted my phone)
US	1	2022-10-05	7.0.0	christie meeee	Loved it, but	I had this game for a while now, im on a really high up level and one day poof i have it no more.

US	1	2022-09-27	6.9.1	fire wolf 🐺	Why?	"I was so loyal to this game, loved it, supported it, and then a sigil called “witchcraft” and stitched up voodoo dolls?! 
What the heck is wrong with people these days?! Why do you do this to loyal players? I’ve finally got EVERYTHING I’ve wanted on that game and you, creators, ruined it, I do not ask for your forgiveness. I wish for this game to never succeed this day forward. So? Players, if you are Christian and hate voodoo and evil, I recommend DO NOT PLAY THE GAME, I swear, those who are reading I am not wasting your time, take advice from someone who has played the game for many years! Goodbye"

US	4	2022-09-26	6.9.1	BoringTutorialHaterCreativeFox	Some things I noticed…	"Hello! I looooovvvvvvvveeeeeeee your game SO much! You are brilliant to come up with this… HOWEVER, I have a few complaints.

First of all, what weirdo would pay 100 real money for a dragon in a GAME?! That is INSANE! I really wanted your Athena dragon, but when I showed the insane price tag to my parents, they practically screamed ‘’No!’’. I understand you as a company have to make money, pay your employees, etc. off a free game, but I promise this is the wrong way to do it! I know other games do the same thing with the over-priced in game purchases, but YOU ARE ABOVE THAT GAMELOFT!!! You are better than that! You have here a wonderful game, but these fat price tags take the fun out of it. I would at least appreciate if you could offer the things you can buy with in game money elsewhere for free. Thanks for understanding why us normal people have a hard time playing this game.

Second of all, oh my gosh! Everything takes FOR-EVER!!!!! Oh wow, new awesome dragon! Oops, sorry, that takes a WHOLE DAY TO HATCH WHAT THE HECK PEOPLE!!!!!!! PPPLLLLLLEEEAASSSSEEEEE minimize the waiting time! Ugh!

And third, the dragons in the store are so expensive. I don’t mean in real money, I mean gems you can buy with real money. Thank you for letting us get gems easier than other games, but 2,000 gems is a silly price for a dragon you can breed by the push of a button. BESIDES, when you go to sell the SAME dragon that was 2,000 gems in the store, you only get COINS!!! Emphasis on the coins! That’s just… ugh! I want gems, what kind of a rip off is this you stupid dragon me Hello! I looooovvvvvvvveeeeeeee your game SO much! You are brilliant to come up with this… HOWEVER, I have a few complaints.

Coins do a few things, but you couldn’t buy the worst dragon in the store for coins! (Well, I say that, they do let you get the beginner dragons and their habitats for coins, but the awesome ones cost gems). 
Just a few things I noticed, thanks for reading! If you want to reach out to me (or send some Athena Dragons my way *wink *wink) then my username is Dragonmaster608108! Byyyyeee!"
US	3	2022-09-24	6.9.1	stormy ⛈🌪	Huge issue…	So I’m giving this game a three out of five stars, because as far as I’m concerned, the game is good. However, I haven’t played in OVER 2 YEARS and my old account is still there, and I have no idea how to play anymore, and the account is just…bad. I need a fresh start, but there is no way to actually restart the game…I would really love to play it but it’s not helpful if I can’t get a fresh start and actually know how to play :/
US	3	2022-09-20	6.9.1	Connie😬😬😬😍😘😛😝😋	First things first. . . .	It’s fine, but it’s almost EXACTLY like DragonCity and on the ads it shows that you can take a picture of food and it makes it into a dragon, and on the preview it shows an avocado dragon but I looked and there is no such thing. But I like dragon city so I guess I like this game too?🙂it’s pretty good.
US	5	2022-09-20	6.9.1	Sofie shelby	Trinkets	"I absolutely love this game! i’m constantly playing it because of how entertaining it is. there isn’t much flaws to this game, except the 
difficulty with enchanting your dragons due to the trinket cost. i have a level 50 dragon that i want to enchant more than just 4 stars, but it is so hard to get the amount of materials i need because of how many trinkets it costs to level those materials up. it costs almost 200 trinkets to enchant 1 material to extraordinary, and i need 23 of those. plus i need to get more extraordinary level ones in other elements so the cost to level materials up is ridiculously expensive. it takes me forever to enchant my dragon for this reason, and it would be very nice if you guys could make the price of it lower. other than this problem, i very much love this game."
US	5	2022-09-18	6.9.1	fans of dragon mania legends	Best game ever	This game is so much fun I love to play this the first I do when get home from school is play dragon mania legends pls add some new dragons 😁:)
US	5	2022-09-15	6.9.1	eaglemaster101	Amazing, but there’s only one issue	I really love the game and think it’s nostalgic. The only problem is names. Names are pretty short and can you make the name limit 20 characters? Thanks
US	4	2022-09-15	6.9.1	SilverMoth115	Thanks to customer service	So I received a response from customer service (thank you so much!) I followed what they recommended and I still encountered the issue. Perhaps the game needs a software or bug update? The glitch mostly happens after the academy, but not all the time. Or if I collect things from my dragons. Can u pls find something on how to fix this? Keep up the helpfulness customer service (is helpfulness a word?) more info on what the issue was is on my other reviews. Still a lover of all dragons 🐉
US	5	2022-09-13	6.9.1	Рома Л.	Классная игра	Игра классная,только иногда цены большие.А ещё почему нельзя добавить человека который играет на пк и андройде
US	4	2022-09-11		SilverMoth115	Issue found…😭	"So I was playing the game today…but all of a sudden it froze with a loading thing in the middle of the screen. I couldn’t tap ANY buttons. WHAT IS GOING ON?! PLEASE FIX THIS I EANT TO PLAY DRAGON MANIA LEGENDS!!!! This game went from making me feel 😊😊😊😊😊to feeling 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭. WHY WONT IT WORK. Please fix this
Still a lover of all dragons"
US	4	2022-09-06	6.9.1	Tommy Rinker	Enchanting dragons	Honestly I love this game but enchanting is a huge pain. Like my asteroid dragon. I have a couple of pieces for the piece rank required but not enough to fuse up to it, but I have like A MILLION EXCELLENT ONES and all they do is gather dust. I would LOVE if you could make the higher tier pieces able to infuse to lower tier pieces, that would make enchanting much more viable for me!
US	5	2022-09-06	6.9.1	SilverMoth115	In love with dragon mania legends	"So I literally just downloaded this game…and I am already in love with it! I mean…the dragons are so cute as babies. How can you not love a cute baby bumblebee dragon? One recommendation just for fun: can u maybe add a feature to dress up the dragons? They would be so cute. Also could you give the dragons a girl or boy gender? It is kinda hard to tell if they are girl or boy. All in all a great game! Sincerely, Lover of all dragons ❤️🐲
I just went into the game and now it keeps freezing on me. What is going on now? I WANT TO PLAY WITH MY DRAGONS PLEASE FIX THIS!!! Still five stars but seriously…please fix this sudden issue."
US	5	2022-09-05	6.9.1	sophia12132012	This is part of the cool games for me!	"This is amazing how the dragons are and stuff like that but when your in a clan of whatever’s it’s called (I keep on forgetting sorry)
If you need those crystal things you click the request thing but what’s frustrating is u only get requests of 2 (might be wrong) I just wish that one day that if u click it you can type it and the max would be 10 crystal things and you would have to type it or use arrows but I still keep it a 5 star because it is the best game EVER in my life I just love the animation your even better then me lol but Keep up the good work and spread your wings!"
US	5	2022-09-05	6.9.1	ebedmad11	A great game	I love dragon mania it’s my favorite game to pass the time. I was accidentally charged for some ancient tickets and stuff but they were incredibly helpful and gave me a full refund. I love this game and all the limited time activities!

I would have never purchased that considering I was 500 way from the limited time dragon and the purchase would not have made a dent. I was robbed and have suggested this game to many friends until now as j have been playing for a year +

US	2	2022-08-29	6.9.1	Enough987123	Frustrating	I have been playing this game for years. They have lots of problems with glitches. Every update results in game glitches. The game is good when it works but horrible when it doesn’t. They seem slow at fixing glitches.
US	5	2022-08-29	6.9.1	FnRaP	Bueno	Esta bueno la verdad bueno
US	5	2022-08-27	6.9.1	Nick shann	Great Game! But can you add one thing?	This is a great game! I really love it! I play it all the time but it would be great if there was an online trading thing where you could trade dragons then it would be an awesome game!  I tell a lot of people about this game and the first thing they usually say is that it would be great if this game could trade! So if you could at that... It would be awesome!
US	4	2022-08-24	6.9.1	Sweetbees6by6	Wish the dragons had more creative shapes	I would love to rate this ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. However, this game’s dragons have maybe five or six shapes. There are fat dragons, snake dragons, and more. YOU NEED TO GET MORE CREATIVE WITH THE DESIGN. Play this game and you WILL see what I mean. Otherwise, great game
US	5	2022-08-24	6.9.1	Charlet yes go	Good game but	Whenever I get an egg if it’s the wrong egg and I already have the dragon please make a options so you can sell it because I don’t like having the same dragon so please make this a thing I waste time for nothing so please do

I had almost had like all the water dragons then I was on a dif Account so then I try to figure out how to go to another account.. it was unsuccessful.. I lost my account and my happness you ruined my day
US	5	2022-08-19	6.9.1	fvgugjyt	My favorite game	I love ❤️ it
US	4	2022-08-15	6.9.1	Too expensive, not enough time	Too expensive	As much as I love this game, there is one problem, everything is so expensive. There is this one dragon I would like to have in my collection but you had to get it with amulets witch you got with shovels which came out every 5 hours and there was a 5% chance you could get the amulet. The dragon I wanted costed 50 amulets which I wasn’t gonna stay up in the middle of the night to get the shovels. At one point I thought maybe I could buy the shovels but they where so expensive. This is not fair because you have to spend a lot of money or literally ALL week foquesing on the game to get ONE limited time dragon.
US	5	2022-08-14	6.9.1	CR-18	Dragons are cute	I love this game so much it is so much fun getting to play with the cutest dragons in the universe this game is like moving to infinity and beyond this game helps me experience the life of a dragon.

US	4	2022-08-08	6.9.1	riahrae91	Love but	Love the game very fun but there is a problem with the dungeon part of the game if you get back to back tasks completed 100% of the time I never get the points for it. So it’s kind of deflating when you could have gotten the dragon at the end of it but because you didn’t receive all the points you should have you come up short. And at the moment it won’t load and we start stared a clan tournament. And my stuff is ready to go.
US	4	2022-08-08	6.9.1	BoringTutorialHaterCreativeFox	A mutual understanding	"I’m not writing this review to be like some of you rude people and be mean to the game company because you had a bad experience. However, I would like to say this; great game with or without the in app purchases. In app purchases are just one of those things you can’t get around: if you want a great game, you HAVE to have them. However, LOTS of things rely on the in game currency called coins, and I ,most unusually, find myself out of coins and needing more. You get plenty of those from your lazy dragons, that just roam around in their habitats and look pretty. But they do give LOTS and I mean lots of gold. Some even give the occasional 1 gem. The dragon are all extremely cute, in like dragon city were they are all the ugliest monsters ever. Dragon city dragon, even the earth dragon surprisingly, can all look cute in their own way. And they have the funniest descriptions! The thing about the dragons is the game wants you to buy some stupid thing called a temple to level the dragons up past 10. The temples take up space and money, and then you might have to buy a new island, and then there’s a 20 habitat limit, and you also have to demolish plants to make a habitat space, including that one little flower for 8,000 coins… you get it. I love they have new ways to level up the dragons, including sigils and enchantments. There are many ways to speed up timers around the island, including gems, special relics, and the local time dragon Chronos, at the top of the mountain of course. I love this game, and even though I am frustrated my username got randomized, wouldn’t ever think of restarting. The reason I titled this mutual is because all good things come with a price (some more literally), but this one it’s a pretty reasonable price to pay. So there’s no reason to giv them 1 star and be mean about it. This is the best your going to get it, and they won’t change everything just because a whiner sent a bast review. I’m not going to be one of you people. I love this game and I’m here to say it. Thanks for reading my long review! Enjoy the game!

US	5	2022-08-03	6.9.1	buddysharkboy	The ADS.	The ADS. They are bad and I 67 percent like them, But this game needs ads removed from it. So developers Pls remove the ads bc I almost hate them bye!
US	4	2022-08-03	6.9.1	shirleyx f z	Okay, listen	"Personally I think this is a very nice game but I have a few things I want to talk about.
1. Events
EVENTS OMG. Some last a month while others last a week. Seriously. the battle events are pretty hard. And I have a suggestion. The last Primal event, I got 25 amulets. But I didn’t get any dragons because I didn’t buy one on time. How about letting the player buy some dragons after the event? I was going to buy 2 because I could afford two, but the event ended. End of Story. Also, event wait times are like FOREVER
2. Times
Okay, seriously. I have to wait 16 hours for the breeding and then a whole day for the hatching? Nothing wrong, but seriously. I get that you would have to wait a bit but that’s a little long. Exploration times. Exploration relics are easy to get ( For me ) so I can’t complain.
3. Ads
Ads, ads, ads. Yes, a game with no ads would usually got money. But honestly, It’s annoying and one pops up every 5 seconds. Ads for rewards. Eh. I can’t really complain about those. But get real.
4. Stuck
I get stuck in an ad every five-ten days or so. Then the game kicks me out. Other times, my iPad just makes odd noises ( I will say my iPad is a 5 year old model ). 

That’s all I’m going to say. Overall, the game is pretty nice"
US	5	2022-08-02	6.9.1	ReinaOtterPup	Lovely	I have played this game for a few years and I suddenly forgot about it when I got a new phone on Christmas, I recently stumbled across the game in my nephews Amazon tablet and decided to get it back. I regret not being able to play for all these years but now I can’t put my phone down. I did feel overwhelmed when I first played but now I enjoy it so much. I love this game! I do have a suggestion however, I wish I could defuse my enchantment material. I have a bunch of extraordinary but no enough of the other ones.
US	3	2022-08-02	6.9.1	Sopherdeez	Good Sides and Bad Sides	"Hi there, I’ve been playing DML for around a year or two (I’m level 76 as of currently), here are my opinions on the game.

Pros- The game is relatively easy to learn/master
-The design and quality of the dragons are cute and unique (unlike Dragon Story which pretty much uses low quality pngs) the dragons even have their own description
-Its semi easy to get gems (though in low quantities) and VIP tickets by doing tasks, getting rewards, doing events
-Fighting mechanics in the game are pretty balanced 
-The game is overall pretty polished

Cons
-Things are ridiculously expensive. Whether it costs a lot of in-game gems or real life money. It’s expensive. For example there is a mid tier legendary dragon on the promotions shop that costs 100USD. Also that promotion seems to pretty much stay there until you buy it. 
-It’s easy to get to a point in the game where you’re stuck. Can’t do anymore battles on the paths or arena because every dragon is 20 levels ahead of you. Currently all of my arena battles are too hard to beat without using 50% damage option (which wastes 2 energy) 
-Levelling up the dragons is nearly impossible after they reach level 40 it seems. Now my dragon wants nearly half a million fruits per 1/4th of a level. It can be super hard to get food in this game if you can’t do anymore battles. 
-Timers on the game are excruciatingly long. Like, breeding and hatching a legendary dragon can take 3 whole days without skipping time.
-There are some things about the game that needs updating or fixing. Like, the weekly jackpot has never been touched in the years I’ve played dml.
-There are SOOO many annoying pop ups, mostly for things they want you to buy. I’m still getting the pop up where it says there’s a new element I haven’t seen before, despite having all of the elements. 
-Events are super stressful. It feels like there’s always 10 events taking place at once, they’re hard to beat (especially the leaderboard events). If you miss one day of gameplay then you’ve basically missed out on everything. Clan events are super stressful, boring, and repetitive and a lot of people leave their clans to take a break from dml because of that. You could literally spend a whole 2,000 gems on an event just to get ONE dragon… for ONE event. 
Ps- I’m not against free-to-play games at all, but there comes a point when developers are just being greedy, and having to spend 100 dollars for 1 legendary dragon (no levels put into it, no gems) is really low. Making all of the dragons cost 1500 to 2000 gems is really low too. The game is too expensive for me to keep up with. 
Here’s one that doesn’t bother me as much but I thought I would point out, some of the animations on the dragon’s pngs are super wonky, like they contort and stretch out super weirdly.

Overall, the game is cute, addicting, decently polished, and family friendly, but it’s a total cash grab so if your kid is playing this game, hide your credit card 😂"
US	5	2022-08-02	6.9.1	black cat 2010	Great game	The ads are not for ages 9+ though, you should make them more kid friendly.
US	4	2022-08-02	6.9.1	🦭🦐🐻‍❄️🦖🦞🐽🐟🦭	So great but yet so bad	I love the game and all but it takes forever for the eggs to hatch because sometimes it takes hours or even days… but I still recommend it and love it.My brother loves it too! But there are a lot of adds which I don’t like.

US	5	2022-08-01	6.8.2	lauren𓇽	I brought back the memories ♥️	So, i had this game when i was like seven and played it all day long when i got home from school, i loved it. Until, today i download it back after atleast 4 years or something, i think. Im excited to try it again i forgot what its about so, ill go see!
US	4	2022-08-01	6.8.2	triggertrey42	Great game	I have played this game for years and years and I loved then and still love it now. But there is one problem. I think that in this game everything takes to long. Eggs will take hours to hatch, or even days. Otherwise it’s a great game.
US	5	2022-07-30	6.8.2	RoVin523	Good	The game is good enough. Maybe they could add some characters made up of YouTubers.
US	4	2022-07-30	6.8.2	BlueOtter124	4 out of 5 stars…	After playing for multiple years on my old laptop,  decided to re-download on my current device. I knew I wouldn’t have my old progress, but that was fine. I was willing to start over. I started to play, but then I realized. You have to pay to do anything. I’m currently opening the agent egg and it’s taking an entire day? I just started playing today! The only way to hatch it now is to pay gems and I don’t want to since I’m saving up for a boss. Everything is taking so long to do. It’s kinna frustrating how I can’t even remove a bush without it taking 5 minutes. I either have to wait a few hours for everything, or pay my own currency for it. And it’s not only in game. Non-valuable dragons are in the shop for a ton of money. They are easy to get once you progress, but here they are being 20 bucks? It’s like the game is scamming you! I feel they don’t have any concern for the lives and hours they are wasting with this game. I gave it 4 out of 5 because besides that I’m in love with the game. It’s amazing. It has good functions, graphics, and an overall concept that is fantastic. But I feel they need to reduce the time that it takes to hatch and harvest stuff. As well reduce the payments. WE GET IT.
US	4	2022-07-30	6.8.2	amomhereforgames	Many gaming options	Started playing this game at my sons request. There are many different game options and milestones that keep the game entertaining. Unfortunately once you get to a certain level, farming enough food to keep your dragons at battle level in the campaign is next to impossible with out making purchases (real money). That makes the game less enjoyable after a point.
US	1	2022-07-30	6.8.2	thatonewafflegirl	Disappointed	I remember loving &enjoying this game, until it started crashing multiple times to the point i couldn't play at all! I downloaded the updates and tried uninstalling it and re-installing it but nothing worked.

US	2	2022-07-28	6.8.2	Xena08	Welp…	I’m disappointed in this game. I enjoyed it $60 in to it. Only to find that I couldn’t add my Facebook friends who do play it as well. Customer service told me that it’s not cross platform. And the said there is nothing to do about that. Friend code 1852b5 kept coming up as invalid. Kind of lame after awhile. Other then this kind of being expensive it’s ok and cute.
US	4	2022-07-27	6.8.2	Mermicorn TV	Great game, but a MAJOR Issue	"I bought premium pass a while back before Season 22 ended. After it did, I lost premium pass! You should warn the player about this! 

Response to Devs: thanks so much! Im sorry for having a bit of attitude in the review, much apologies from me were necessary! I know it was just a few measly dollars, but i was only frustrated with this. And it wasn’t that I didn’t receive the items, it’s that I bought premium pass when there were like 2 days left of the season, don’t refund me, it’s not a big deal. Overall, this is an amazing game with awesome  design! Again, thanks so much, you have a magical day aswell ❤"

    My only ask is that the creators bring back the zodiac dragons event!! It was really fun trying to get the dragon for your month. However, when I started playing, my month had already passed. I’d love another shot at it!! 
Best regards ❤️"
US	5	2022-07-14	6.8.2	the_vine_queen	Great Game (needs minor changes)	"I’ve been playing this game for about 5 years now. It’s so much fun to plan out your team and battle other dragons, and the variety between dragons is a nice touch! There are over 900 which you can get in different ways. 
The only problem is that the divine and ancient events are extremely pay-to-win for newer players. It sometimes seems like you need divines/ancients in order to get more divines/ancients. 
Other changes should probably be made, like storing eggs after breeding, or more multiplayer features. Overall though, great game."
US	4	2022-07-12	6.8.2	andidanie	MAJOR flaw	I’ve played for like five days and this game is petty fun. Breed, feed fight, and repeat. Complete quests to get dragons. Don’t use your gems for time. Make sure your organized. But the major flaw is… okay say your in a two ad break but once it’s done… your in a black screen and can’t get out😡☹️. Major flaw and brings down my score. Otherwise this game is pretty fun.

US	2	2022-06-29	6.8.2	capomaster1708	Fun game but…	The game is pretty fun to play (I have been doing it for a few years now) but you cannot possibly enjoy it properly unless you are willing to spend lots of money and lots of time playing it. If you are not, then this game is not for you as you cannot compete nor win anything worthy.

US	5	2022-06-27	6.8.2	𝔾𝔸𝕝𝕚𝕩𝕪𝕡𝔸𝕟𝕕𝔸𝟙𝟚𝟘𝟟	Needs just 2 improvements and my experience of the game	The reasons it needs improvement: So I luv the game and it’s my go to game when I am bored or something like that but I am at max habitats for most habitats that I need such as fire wind earth and water I now gotta upgrade my habitats that I have so I can have more dragons cuz like everyday I am breeding them and getting new eggs. It takes so many hours to hatch an egg or breed the dragons or to use the academy if the dragon is not the first few dragons you get at the start of the game if it just like the fire dragon or wind dragon it won’t take that long it take like 2 mins but if it like the agent one it takes a while the earth ones don’t take that long ether about like 4 mins and the smoke dragon and bee dragon take around 5 to 8 mins. My experience: So I started out with first few dragons you get and habitats and farm I started to bread them and do battles and blah blah so like most games you start out slow which I did but I catches up pretty fast. I have had this game for about like 5 months and I have enjoyed it till I now have max habitats I can only get the plant habitat but anyway it is a really fun game. An idea for an update: So my idea is that everyone can make a dragon design and the top 20 or 15 will have there designs as a new dragon! And the players who have there ideas as a new dragon they get there dragon for FREE they also get 20k coins Overall it is really really good and it is not hard to play and it’s pretty cool how you can breed and hatch dragons.Thanks for reading and have a wonderful day/night/morning/afternoon
US	3	2022-06-27	6.8.2	Mermicorn TV	It’s ok	"Overall, I love dml, like, a lot, but there are tons of problems i could go nonstop about. 
First, the game is pretty much pay-to-win, which gives me a lot of anxiety, i have wasted tons of money and still havent got any special dragons. It gets so annoying, and I'd appreciate it if it wasn’t like this at all.
I also have some suggestions.
I wish I could downgrade enchantment materials, just to get what’s required to enchant my dragons. It could cost a lot more or less, I don’t care as long as this would be added.
As I said earlier, I hate this game only because it’s pay to win, otherwise, it’s a good game, I HATE the way that it’s pay to win, please, gameloft, make it to where it isn’t, it’ll be a much more enjoyable game.
Also, no offense, but you’re kind of acting like this is 2002 (I can’t explain the context very well), and this is the only reason this game shouldn’t have more recognition than DC.
One last thing, I don’t want to upgrade my hatchery and portal with instant upgrade, I would love if I could spend gold and wait for the upgrades instead of them just being instant, because it’s a lot of gems I have to 
pay. 
I love this game overall, and the style is lovely, but I hope you can keep improving this game :)
Thanks,"

US	3	2022-06-24	6.8.2	olegangster	Great game ! But…	DML was one of my favourite games back in 2018-2019 , It had(and has now) great graphics, good battles, and 100’s of different dragons,I had so much fun playing it, but now, In 2022, I started playing again, and Im quite disappointed with the amount of commercials, and donation required items. You want to get a dragon from a free BP -sure , get 5 fragments, to get the other 10 you will need premium BP. You want to play after a hard day of work and relax a little? no problem, but you will have to watch 10 ada within 25 minutes. Ok , getting free items by watching commercials is fine, skipping time with them is ok too. But popping up banners, and videos every 2 mins is too much, it s ruining every moment of playing this game, and leaves you feeling stressed and totally not relaxed. I would like playing DML so much more if not those things, and I do understand that developers need money, buy with that amount of commercials they will only lose players(( Hope y’all will see this review and change something in this wonderful game.

WAYYY better than dragon city the dragons are cool and well designed and the game is constantly updating. There is always things to do in this game events like every week online players. I have been playing this game for almost a while YEAR and I have no intention of stopping. A recommend this game to anyone who just wants to have a great time!
US	1	2022-06-24	6.8.2	I don't know about you	DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS MONEY GRABBER	I asked for help from support and still got no reply long after.   This game just focuses on taking your real money. It’s TONS OF ADVERTISING and to get anywhere you have to spend REAL MONEY.  DN’T LET YOUR KIDS GET HOOKED ON IT.  IT’S A BAD DRUG FOR KIDS.   keep your money safe.  It’s extremely repetitive farming game with no real action at all.  They hook you on buying unique dragons for real money.  DON’T.  DON’T have this on your device.  They collect data, tracking.
US	5	2022-06-22	6.8.2	Holovent	Please delete my game progress	Please I really want to restart the game
US	4	2022-06-21	6.8.2	Mystic_Wolf2010	4 stars	This game is amazing I love it but I think that it shouldn’t have to require internet.I live in a place where the internet isn’t very good and when I try to speed up my egg hatching process it puts me in the loading screen and I don’t get my add.All my other games work except for this one
US	4	2022-06-21	6.8.2	heyyyyy b-money	Dragon mania	I like this game but sometimes I think it’s a little annoying how u have to wait like over a day for some to hatch, and it takes a long time to load
US	1	2022-06-21	6.8.2	nobipotat	Cursing in the ads	Are all of the games cursing in ads or is it just this one.?
US	1	2022-06-20	6.8.2	americanmadeanon	Terrible game maintenance	My account, and hundreds of other accounts, quit working when the June 2022 dragon board event began. I can’t log in at all through Facebook or a browser and when there’s a pop up on the app it shuts the app down. There are Many popups in DML. Devs won’t help you with issues in the game, they aren’t helping me. There’s 13 days left on the current 30 day event, I just hope my account starts working properly again when it’s over. Just days before the event began I purchased an extra den with cash, I really feel like I’m being ripped off right now since it’s timed so I’ve missed three weeks of use st this point. What a ripoff DML has turned out to be :(

US	1	2022-06-18		americanmadeanon	DML is a scam and apple is helping them steal money! Don’t spend money in this game!	"I made a purchase just before this current 30 day singles event then when the event started my account is blocked from playing…grrr! DML ‘developers’ need to go back to school. Thanks to them MANY players can’t play the game atm. DML is a joke

UPDATE: DML &amp; Apple charged me $4.99 for a purchase I didn’t make two days ago. This is the second time DML has stolen money from my account, which isn’t even working btw, with no help or resolution. Apple won’t even respond back to me after requesting information. 

I highly recommend you find a better game"
US	3	2022-06-17	6.8.2	Jite25	Deceptive ads	The ads for this game show a person scanning objects to unlock dragons of the item scanned. In reality, you get the dragons by combining in game only. In the ad to get say a lava dragon you scan lava with your phone but in the game you breed a fire and an air dragon and the result is a chance.
US	5	2022-06-16	6.8.2	jkmkUwU	I love this game	5 stars
US	5	2022-06-15	6.8.0	hhhhrte	Habitats	"DML is a good game except that for me it says I can not place anymore habitats even though I cleared more place for them.
The only way I can place more habitats is when I use the VIP card. But everything else in the game is awesome"
US	5	2022-06-15	6.8.0	Gamyack	BEST GAME FOR A DRAGON FAN	Okay, OMG this game is so cool. Most dragon games advertise “scan the donut and you get a donut dragon”. Even when the game actually doesn’t. This game totally doesn’t do that, and mostly everything they advertise is in the game. (I can’t know for sure because I haven’t seen EVERY SINGLE ADD FOR THIS GAME. ). :). This game is full of Legends and immersive gameplay. Disregarding what the age recommendation says, this game could be fun for people of all ages. (I’m 9!) :) My sister was only 4 when she started. If you are thinking about getting it for a younger child, take into account you may have to read things to them. There are In app purchases in the game, but you can continue and play the game without buying things. It is equally enjoyable if you buy things or not. Most of the things you pay real money for are available after gameplay. Now I haven’t even STARTED about the dragons! There are all so many unique obtainable dragons that are available through everyday gameplay. Enjoy playing, training, and feeding your dragons. Each different dragon has their own funny description. (If you care to read it). Expand your dragon codex every time you buy, breed, or hatch a new dragon. Explore EPIC events. Events allow you to obtain Cool, and rare new dragons that are normally not available through everyday gameplay. Like the cool BRAND NEW primal dragons. Level up and expand your dragon world. Join Clans with fellow dragon trainers, and participate in limited time Clan events. Next you have to know about the amazing battles and the importance to the legends, and storyline they contain. The battles take place with Arya and Toby the 2 main dragon trainers, and the enemy Vikings. The story and, setting of these battles make the game all the more fun. THIS GAME IS HONESTLY ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES I STARTED PLAYING. (Remember I am 9). And you may think you will never catch with spldrip the number one on the leaderboard, and has been for years. But as you progress legendaries, ancients, divines, and possibly PRIMALS will get easier to obtain. And this review is getting quite long. So just to sum it up, like the best game totally recommend it to you, and, once you are level 25 consider joining my Clan, Dragon Mania Girls! My name is DragonMaster113546! Peace out!-A person who plays the sims 4 every weekend.
US	5	2022-06-14	6.8.0	AMYTHING2	The  best game ever	l LOVE IT
US	2	2022-06-12	6.8.0	get idvdhdbdh	Trash	This game is so bad every thing is over priced and such a pay to win game like just get dragon city
US	1	2022-06-11	6.8.0	americanmadeanon	Don’t spend money in this game!	I made a purchase just before this current 30 day singles event then when the event started my account is blocked from playing…grrr! DML ‘developers’ need to go back to school. Thanks to them MANY players can’t play the game atm. DML is a joke
US	2	2022-06-10	6.8.0	No_ads_!!!!!	Ads	The game itself is fun. I enjoy having multiple things to do in one game. My only complaint is the ads. The amount of pop up ads is absolutely ridiculous and annoying. I want to play the game. I don’t want to see ads for other games or anything else that I have zero interest in. I can understand having an ad here or there, but have one pop up every time I do something is unnecessary.
US	4	2022-06-09	6.8.0	NinjaNerd_L	I like the game but one thing	So I haven’t played dragon mania legends in a while now and I went back on it and I lost all of my progress
US	3	2022-06-09	6.8.0	parker45346576	Fine	"I left a 3 star review because it has some bugs.
It good fine if you ask me but the real problem is every thing costs  money I mean real money and the price some of it is like 90 dollars that’s a lot of money why"
US	4	2022-06-08	6.8.0	Oxyahna	Mixed	Been playing for a couple years. Love the game, though at times it becomes so busy must choose one event over another. My biggest issue right noe is the faulty videos currently. Videos don’t play, I don’t get the reward. Been happening for months.  Would walk away but too much time invested. Besides I really do love this game!
US	1	2022-06-08	6.8.0	Tommy9565	Boring	The game requires you to grow dragons but limits the number of farms available to grow food, growing times are super long (should be a 12 hour time), and so while there are ever increasing food requirements, you can’t get enough food...this results in the game just being a log in, do the daily routine of collecting money, collect food, plant more and wait until tomorrow then do it again.  Very disproportionate availability of food and requirements compared to ability to generate and produce
US	4	2022-06-07	6.8.0	mariah😍🥰🙃 123	Good game but a problem	"I this get breed dragons is really fun but  after playing for a few I realized that I could not add any 
more dragons with out using my own money on a app that was so positive been free now I can’t play any until this update because I don’t want to spend my money on a game"
US	1	2022-06-07	6.8.0	americanmadeanon	DML stole $50 frm me. I got brushed off	DML is so buggy that many of us can’t even play, the game shuts me out when I try to log in :(( Every singles event…I can’t play. The game won’t send me creatures to catch. What pisses me off is I just spent real money in the game and then they do this THING that shuts out so many players with no explanation. I can’t even log in through my Facebook account to play, the game won’t open. I have four accounts so I know how it should act. Too bad the techs don’t know how to keep this game in good shape, I’ve been playing for four years now and have enjoyed dml until the glitches began in about the past year. If you have issues, I doubt they’ll be fixed. And, you won’t be contacted when you report them. Of course, you can ignore my gripes but after the game stole $50 from me in another account…I’m kinda pissed…they wouldn’t refund. All I got was a big runaround from gameloft. I recommend none of the games from this crappy company
US	3	2022-06-07	6.8.0	Crystal kimora🍦🍑	Why do I have to log in?!	"My brother downloaded this and I wanted to try it too. 
He doesn’t need to log in and already has lots of dragons
He also has secure gameplay without logging why do I have to ？Bad review"
US	5	2022-06-07	6.8.0	Kokopuff18	Amazing	I got so addicted to this game and I love it so much I overall give it an amazing review. 👍👍
US	5	2022-06-06	6.8.0	bbbgggggghhghhhhhhhh	Rfffff	Edcccfffddxxxx
US	4	2022-06-05	6.8.0	r-r-randomness	Amazing… but the timers	Don’t get me wrong here this game is straight up amazing but there is one small little problem… the timers. I will go to the breeding den to breed my dragons and then like sometimes get rare ones like yesterday I got the cyborg dragon but then I will have to wait like a day or something to put in the hatchery and then once its in there i have to wait another day to hatch then if I don’t already have a habitat i have to wait another couple of hours to build a habitat and like you see the whole process takes around three days and i know you can use diamonds to speed it up but you guys make it way too hard to actually get diamonds like i never have more than ten its really frustrating. You can also buy diamonds but I’m a kid and can’t spend real money overall this game is my favorite even on the fire tablet i used to have if you can fix these issues than DML deserves 6 stars
US	5	2022-06-05	6.8.0	IceKx	INAPPROPRIATE ADDS POPS UP	Beware of inappropriate adds popping up.If you switch device you will loose every dollar you spend along your progress.
US	3	2022-06-04	6.8.0	ummhhh	Mickelle	Hate the new dungeon. Wish it wasn’t quite so expensive to feed dragons. And to be really competitive it’s really expensive. The rest of the game is fun. I have an erratic work schedule so sometimes I do really well at timed events and sometimes I almost miss the whole thing. I love the new ancient dragons. We need a strong ancient with the wind element. Also it is EXTREMELY annoying to have the blurb pop up with ayraoffering oh there’s a dragon with a new element go look at it. when you go look at it and it’s not there because you’re not gonna give us access to it because we’re not high enough level or whatever requirement it is you’re not gonna give the dragon stop prompting and advertising it!
US	4	2022-06-04	6.8.0	ShortyKimmie1127	Great	This is a fun game, but I think dragons should be able to level up with experience points from battles as well as food. 🙂
US	5	2022-06-04	6.8.0	madden pro11309	I like it but…	I can’t get into the game unless I update it and that’s not cool
US	1	2022-06-03	6.8.0	لاعب على وشك الجنون	لاعب غاضب	لعبتكم تحتاج إلى تحسينات فالفعاليات تتكرر ولا تأتي فعاليه جديده مفاجأه والفعاليات القديمه صعبه جدا بشكل مبالغ فيه
US	5	2022-06-03	6.8.0	patito cuack cuack	Excellent game	Este juego esta chido y es uno de mis favoritos ya que tienes una gran variedad de cosas que hacer y hay muchos dragones que están muy bonitos y chidos very good:)
US	4	2022-06-03	6.8.0	JL Lou	Updates	I easily downloaded the new update to my iPad but my iPhone 13 pro max will not download the new update. Nor will it let me go past the “download new update” screen!  Very frustrated by this.
US	5	2022-06-01	6.8.0	the bigest dragon mania fan	Amazing	I just love it and recommend it
US	5	2022-05-31	6.8.0	Reviews firs	Excellent Game	This is better than Dragon City it is the best game ever I really like. Hope you do too.
US	1	2022-05-30	6.7.1	123456880	Bruh	This dumb app is just a stupid rip-off of dragon city.A much better game than this trash.No one really likes this game and the stupidest people will like the game and call it a work of art because it was copied.I think 5-year olds have made this game trash.The app shop should delete this as soon as someone brings the 5-year old(or dumb kid with -100,000,000)to the judge and destroy the game with there wooden hammer .I am really shocked than it has not been sued yet.So just throw it in the trash and delete this game on your phone and never play it again.Never let kids play this dumb trash.Never let elders play the game.So stop!
US	5	2022-05-30	6.7.1	luke525252	Peyton	This is so fun for me! I love this!💕💕💕
US	5	2022-05-28	6.7.1	Mermicorn TV	An Excellent Game!	Dml is probably one of the best mobile games I will play in my entire lifetime! I love that the devs release many dragons and fun events often, which makes this game not repetitive like most, it keeps me enjoying the game, and there are so many features of this game I adore, such as heroic mode, it adds tons of extra challenge to the original map, which is just awesome! With the timing and the use of math in this game, it will help build your mind and relax yourself. Breeding dragons is always an option too! It&#39;s a great way to test luck and see those results! It&#39;s a great game to relieve stress and anxiety, it just gets your mind off of it. Even if there&#39;s pop-up ads constantly coming, it&#39;s still fun to play, for me, only a simple purchase made can remove all of those ads, which is great! I love the calendar events and all of the battles you can fight in! Oh! And there are tons of dragons to collect, it&#39;s just phenomenal! Overall, this game is amazing and it needs to be recognized more than dragon city!
US	1	2022-05-28	6.7.1	IceKx	17+ adds popping up.	Beware of inappropriate adds popping up.
US	5	2022-05-28	6.7.1	NaomisaPrincess	It’s so fun	It’s so fun I love it so much I hope it has more updates
US	5	2022-05-26	6.7.1	Unicorngirl108	Great game.	(NOT A BOT) I love this game a lot but there are a lot of ads. I know you need ads to make money. Overall a good game.
US	1	2022-05-25	6.7.1	Mentole	This game has went WAY down hill.	"This game use to be fun a few years ago, but ever since they added sigils than ruined enchantments by combining them with the arena the game is just horrible. It was already hard to get enchantments for legendary, divine, and ancient skills before the change, now it is all but impossible to do it. Especially since you are constantly put up against teams you can’t possibly beat. You get 3 choices of who to fight and constantly all 3 choices have are 3 dragons 10+ levels higher than any of yours.

They have made some really stupid changes and I haven’t spent a dime on this game in over a year and refuse to even watch the advertisements any more. I only even play now for the clan I am in and hope they will change the stupid changes to something better."
US	5	2022-05-23	6.7.1	pg grace	Presley’s comment	This is a really good game but they need to give us more gems instead of making us use our real money to buy them
US	5	2022-05-22	6.7.1	Unicorngirl108	Great game.	I love this game a lot but there are a lot of ads. But I know you need ads to make money. Overall a good game.
US	2	2022-05-22	6.7.1	SparkyOpal	Friend request	It is useless game if I can’t add friends o have them add me.   I have been sending friend requests over a few days on my game but no one accept my request.   Thinking about uninstalling this game
US	5	2022-05-22	6.7.1	Elgalina	Suggestion	"This game is honestly the best game I have ever played, and I’ve been happily playing and collecting for years.

However, I do have a strong suggestion.
Being able to downgrade enchanting materials would be very helpful, instead of just upgrading. I need average materials but don’t have any poor ones, while I have excellent materials just sitting around, useless. If I could break them down into what I needed, I’d be much happier, thank you!"
US	4	2022-05-21	6.7.1	Ragheb	Good and bad	The game is awesome but few flaws one is that everything that costs gems is overpriced for example just a uncommon dragon is about 300 gems! Two is that in event “divine fest springtime passions it is so hard to get holy talasmans. That means you can’t get so many dragon pieces (because you need to collect so many dragon pieces to get those dragons)  three is that why does is it take so long to hatch and breed dragons those are the pros and cons of the app. But overall amazing game!

US	4	2022-05-14	6.7.1	anonymous6382634219	I love this game but…	"I love this game and have been playing for a around few years but, I think it would be cool if there was a new element added but a common one that we would buy and be able to actually breed with other dragons to create other dragon with that element. Because I haven’t been able to do that in a while or it would be cool if more dragons were worth money. 

But my complaint is about the treasure hunt challenge I think there should be a “are you sure” button before you get a dragon because I just wasted all my tokens I won on a dragon I didn’t want because I accidentally pressed the wrong dragon. When I was trying to safe up for the primal dragon. 

Thank you for reading this, hope this problem can be fixed"

US	3	2022-05-05	6.7.1	Danibee_4	Good game! But..	DML is one of those games that I’ve played for so long, I’d lost interest and then get back into it, and then lose interest, and get back into it. The game overall has very good concepts and events but there’s one big problem with it. It’s incredibly hard to really “win” unless you pay real money for it. :/ Everything in the game is so expensive. I enjoy this game so much, it’s honestly really sad to write such a low star review but it’s something that this game really lacks. I hope you fix this in the future!
US	1	2022-05-05	6.7.1	Rawnoodles	Ads ads ads ads	Holy crap the ads are never ending. They’re also unwarranted, like i get if you voluntarily play an ad for extra currency or to speed up a building but i get an ad for just clicking to upgrade or to perform an action. Yeah that’s a no from me dawg.

US	5	2022-04-22	6.7.1	Thatkid202	A Beginner’s view	"Overall as a beginner, the game is really fun, relatively simple, and getting onto your feet is very easy. The first few battles are very easy, which I thought was a nice touch. As I play more, I hope to unlock more features and have fun!

A while later, I have advanced a lot, and I am paste the first island in the battles mode. For a casual player like me, the battles go by at a good pace. I have encountered no bugs and no crashes, and I am looking to buy my second island! I do think that it should be easier to get gems fast in game, without paying, and maybe a way to trade dragons. The only annoying thing about this game for me was that often there would be no easy or medium players to challenge, and I would drop down in the ranks. Overall, I still think that the game deserves 5 stars"
US	4	2022-04-21	6.7.1	Track80	Fun Game With Lots to Do	"I’ve been playing this game for a few weeks, but I understand that this game has been around for several years so I am way behind some players.  There are lots of different challenges, various battles, and hundreds of dragons to collect, feed, and upgrade.  The game actually requires you to come up with strategy and plans on how you progress in the game and get the most out of it.  Best advice I have is to save your gems to buy and upgrade an eternal fruit tree as early as possible and upgrade your hatchery to at least 2 eggs because they will pile up quickly.

I have found it to be really fun and my kids like to feed and hatch dragons and watch the battles.  There are quite a few ads throughout the game to either get access to free things or time reductions.  Also ads will just pop up randomly if you click around.  I guess that’s how the game pays the bills.  Just beware that some of the ads are not appropriate for kids in my opinion.  The do have all sorts of ways they want you to spend your money in the game but I haven’t bought anything yet.

So disappointed."
US	5	2022-04-19	6.7.1	Thatkid202	A Beginner’s view	Overall as a beginner, the game is really fun, relatively simple, and getting onto your feet is very easy. The first few battles are very easy, which I thought was a nice touch. As I play more, I hope to unlock more features and have fun!
US	2	2022-04-18	6.7.1	Kings7kid	I can’t even see the game and hear the game either.	😫😫😫😠😠😠😠😭😭😤😤
US	5	2022-04-17	6.7.1	liamr57	Very fun but	The game does not load
US	5	2022-04-17	6.7.1	EndMyMiseryTheThird	Great game	"I love this game. I’ve been playing consistently for the past 6 years, and over those years I’ve seen some amazing updates and improvements for gameplay. 

Unfortunately, I’ve also seen a huge increase in “in-game” purchases. As someone who can afford to spend some cash, I don’t have any personal problem with this. But I know most people aren’t willing to spend $99.99 for an item that will be spent within minutes."
US	5	2022-04-17	6.7.1	Kindhhdhd	Best mobile game i have ever played	This game might not look it but it is so fun to gradually play this game and build physical and relationships with these dragons. I love this game more than life itself and it means so much to me. It gives me something to do when i’m not hanging out with all my friends that I have. A cool thing that I learned while playing this game is, the higher the rarity of the dragon, the more  it gets, if u know what i mean😻😩😛💦. In all this game really helped me in ways u wouldn’t imagine😩. And in all I recommend this game to all those single folks out there. I LOVE DML!!!
US	1	2022-04-16	6.7.1	udducxtx try gcyxtsh	Ok	It’s pretty confusing and not super interesting
US	5	2022-04-16	6.7.1	sgianoukos1	Great game….	I love the game it’s self! I love breeding and challenging others. But the only thing I don’t get are the ads? You have ads that show you can use a camera to create dragons,yet that’s not on the real game? Yes I downloaded the game because I wanted to use the camera, but I still love the game. Just one things is to fix your ads, or add to the game.
US	4	2022-04-16	6.7.1	Zoe with the Dots	How do we understand	I really wanted to know how like you see those things in the ads right like they show you things like for this ad they show you oh you grab a camera or something and take a photo of a random object and it comes into a dragon but when I was trying to like see how to do that I couldn’t really know so like how do we understand because you put that in the ad but I don’t really know I had to like do you know what I’m saying like I don’t really know but I’ll give you a star trade I’ll give you probably like four stars I really like the game though but I really hope that you put it in the game because I’m a beginner so I hope you put that in the game because I’m a beginner I don’t really know what’s happening you know so I guess I’ll keep playing the game till like see if I’m wrong or right because I thought it just lets you take a photo right away Okay.
US	1	2022-04-15	6.7.1	Blahboh	Ads	Ads. Ads. More ads. Grind. Ads. Money grab.
US	5	2022-04-14	6.7.1	gieser dragon lv25	It’s great	So when I first got the game it was hard then now that I have the light element and a lv25 dragon it’s super easy and all the events make is suspenseful and makes it super fun but some things I wish that the gem prices where lowered also the dragons sometimes I can be really hard to hatch because they take so longI recently got the Ned dragon and taking four days because it’s a legendary
US	5	2022-04-13	6.7.1	Nicky Masterpole	An Amazing Game	This is an amazing game we’re you can breed dragons to get new ones and you can also fight with friends and other players. You should definitely get this game!
US	5	2022-04-12	6.7.1	pls have Sonic exe mod	The best dragon game	This game has everything I wished for so I gave this game a 5 star review
US	1	2022-04-09		TamamaCandyLover	The ads ruin it	Seriously why am I getting so many ads on this? Is there no way of turning the ads off? The game is perfect otherwise.
US	2	2022-04-08	6.7.1	cmucmuc	Almost unplayable	First of all there’s only 1 thing good that’s the battle System it’s actually not bad but there are a lot a bad thing like the ads that pop up randomly and the breeding almost makes impossible to collect them and also please add the ability to cancel or sell eggs
US	5	2022-04-08	6.7.1	AMONG US 333	Awesome game	Dragon mania legends is a great game that is basically a better version of dragon city. It’s free to play and has lots of unique features that help you build, collect and more!
US	2	2022-04-06	6.7.1	EJ55Powers	Money grab!	If you love ads and constantly purchasing stuff then you’ll love this game! You cannot just simply play this game without an adult popping up, or open the game without buying something being stuffed down your throat. I enjoyed this at first but now it’s annoying. Pass
US	3	2022-04-05	6.7.1	somonedissapointed69	Why ads ?	The game is completely online and you cant play offline then why is it loaded with ads, every minute i spend in the game at least i get 4 ads don’t get me wrong i adore this game but why is the ads necessary it really kill the vibes i am having while playing, it didn’t use to be like this i hope you rethink the decision and make the game ads free again , thank you.
US	5	2022-04-04	6.7.1	ehahzhshzbxbs	YouTube series	"So I’ve been reading a ton of reviews on this since I do gaming videos I was thinking I should do a YouTube series on this! I played this  game before but I’m planning on finishing the whole game! If u do want to check out my channel it’s Yeti_Arham
Anyways thanks for reading have a good day 🌟💯"
US	5	2022-04-03	6.7.1	polly pikles	Love it 🥰	It’s so much 🤩
US	4	2022-04-03	6.7.1	_someone123_	Really good! Just one problem	I have loved this game for a while, and I really like it! I just find the ads extremely annoying. It’s difficult to go two minutes before seeing another pop-up. Also, when I choose to watch an ad for a reward, the reward is often delayed and sometimes (albeit rarely) isn’t given at all. Beyond that though, great game!
US	5	2022-04-02	6.7.1	gieser dragon lv25	It’s great	So when I first got the game it was hard then now that I have the light element and a lv25 dragon it’s super easy and Al the events make is suspenseful and makes it super fun
US	2	2022-04-01	6.7.1	MyMonsterRocks	Frustrating	The game is fun, but the constant video advertisements make it difficult to enjoy. Not to mention this game is geared for children, yet one of the advertised games is highly inappropriate (sexually suggestive) for my child playing this game.  I would pay for the game to remove the constant videos/advertisement.
US	5	2022-04-01	6.7.1	BroWaggle9	It’s good but	When I’m playing it and I watch a ad for a prize it always freezes
US	1	2022-04-01	6.7.1	xilan	Sleazy attempts to force downloads	"Increasingly notice ""30 second"" ads are much longer than 30 seconds and are now seeing ads that won't let you exit without either downloading the app or force quitting the app and losing progress. Sleazy!"
US	5	2022-03-31	6.7.1	WinsomeNightmare	Best Game	"I’ve had this game when I was, and I loved it, and I still do. I have always had this fascination with dragons, I mean they’re mythical flying creatures, that breath fire, and look cool doing it. They’re are menacing, dangerous, and glorious. And what can make these creatures better? Making them more cuter. I mean this game is whole package. I can satisfy my insatiable craving of becoming a powerful dragon trainer with this game. I have created an army, and I am so proud of my dragons. I also appreciate the creators for blessing us with these events, they increase my chances in recruiting new dragon members to my soon to be world domination. Thank you everyone for reading, thank you creators for creating, and thank you dragons, for existing.

Your amazing dragon fanatic"

US	1	2022-03-30	6.7.1	Stinkles amazing	great game but ads are not it	there needs to be a system that filters ads because ive been getting ads constantly for games that are 18+ and very inappropriate for children, but this game is rated 9+, so obviously children would be seeing those ads. just something i think should be fixed. other than that i love this game. ive been playing for 5 years and the only reason im rating it so low is so that hopefully one of the creators will see it and make a change.
US	1	2022-03-30	6.7.1	Chieffelix47	Flooded with ads	"Couldn’t play the game for 30 seconds without getting a 15-30 second long ad forcibly played on my screen.

Idk who is giving these fake 5 star reviews. No one would put up with that kind of game. If you don’t believe me try it out.

I didn’t get any ads the first few days, but after about a week of playing without spending money I got ads every 30 seconds. If you don’t plan on spending money, this game is just an ad simulator. Stay clear of it."
US	5	2022-03-30	6.7.1	Picture it	Best game Ever!! 👍😁👍	I love dragon mania legends, it’s so fun. There’s not really anything I could think of to make this game better than it is now. Whoever made this game they’re smarter than me. I play it everyday. It helped me get through covid.

US	5	2022-03-29	6.6.6	MEEPboi7	Epic game!	This is an awesome and amazing game and I love the look and feel of the speedy and cool dragon game (which is this one)!
US	1	2022-03-28	6.6.6	Stturn	Money eater	This game says you won a dragon, but makes you pay to get it.  It is full of things you can only get with money, then charges you again.  If you think imaginary dragons are worth watching money Down the drain, buy it.  It also features things like “storage” which I never found. User unfriendly, only way t  ok learn to play is trial and error.  A hub with a list of active places would really be nice.

Just wish you could battle friends for training and or trade stuff with them without being in a clan or like breed with each other’s dragons to unlock new dragons. Lots all the updates! Gotta collect all legendary
US	1	2022-03-24	6.6.6	youguystookalltjegoodnames	Too many ads	I understand this is a free game DML has an ungodly amount of ads popping up about every 15 mins and the dragons cost waaaay too much to feed especially when the farm doesn’t work around the clock like other free games
US	1	2022-03-23	6.6.6	Big Stevie 4 Life	Meh!!	Fun game but too many ads for a game with so much freemium content . I would expect this more from a free puzzle game that there is no incentive to buy gems or other items for real money. I will eventually delete this once it’s not fun enough to keep dealing with the ads
US	1	2022-03-22	6.6.6	FlameDaGame	To many ads	I hate how many ads this game has and how it always try’s to get you to pay real money. Also very buggy in some areas.

US	1	2022-03-21	6.6.6	jfhvjvk	Too many adds	I like the game but I’m living the game because it’s add and another add it’s already a wasted time playing but with all these adds…terrible
US	3	2022-03-21	6.6.6	zacky100000	Too many ads and hard to get gems	First thing it’s really hard to get gems either pay or get them by doing quest using currencies to get them I think and just too many ads please remove the ads every time I click things habitat my dragons habitat and just remove the part where you have to watch an ad to get a board just no i’m probably never gonna watch ads to get rewards because somehow to take like 50 seconds and I’m not can I wait 50 seconds just to get like a few coins or gems

What else could a dragon nerd want?"
US	5	2022-03-19	6.6.6	Jadzia🐱	This game is awesome, it just needs something more.	"I LOVE this game. The dragons are cute, the battles are cool, the back round music is pretty, you get 20 gems after an update, and you can pet and feed the dragons! 5 stars! Although, every time I play it, I just think it needs something MORE. Like, you’re a dragon trainer, shouldn’t you be able to, ride the dragons or something? It would be cool. That’s a big update though and it’s already a great game. Thanks for reading!
Jadzia"
US	2	2022-03-19	6.6.6	mruss333	Ok, but .	Could be a better game without all the pop up advertising that you are forced to watch.

US	5	2022-03-16	6.6.6	BasicBlueberry	Best game ever!	I love this game, you can fight and level up your dragons! There are so many dragons to choose from and they are all so cool and strong!
US	4	2022-03-16	6.6.6	_nanaya	An honest review	"If you’re thinking about downloading this game, just do it. Buuut…
I’ve been playing this game 4 years by now. I really enjoy since the day 1 and I still like to this day. It’s fun, you have a lot of events, new dragons very often also new type of dragons, like, it’s not a forgotten game and I think that’s awesome from the creator’s part: they care about their game.
However, there’s a few things here and there that prevents me from giving a 5-star rating. To name a few, let’s start with the fact that things are expensive. I know that bigger levels requires bigger competitors, but somehow is not everyone who can spend $99,00 or even $5,00 to have gems/diamonds. And in the game coin, at some point is kinda annoying how expensive is to level up habitats or farms. And talking about farms, there’s another downside: how much dragons have to consume to level up. I think it’s fair in way or other to increase how much food you need to feed your dragons, but it’s annoying to spend so much in food, because if your dragon is not increasing their level, you’re stuck in the game. I remember in 4 years playing, that at some point I didn’t play for more than 5 months because I couldn’t pay for more food and all the food I had I “lost” in just one dragon to level up just one level.
In this new update what’s really pissing me off, is the magma’s lair; I need 3 RARE dragons level 31+ to find the last ruin/piece of Cronos… I don’t have food to level up 3 dragons to level 31+, I need to feed my 3 main dragons because it’s with them that I go to battles… So right now, I think it’s impossible to me have Cronos. This level thingy to find ruins of Cronos is really, really annoying, if I could have just one wish to the creators, I would ask to remove this, for God’s sake. 
(A tip to new players: make sure to be smart when making your “big 3”. Make rare or epic dragons as your big 3, or even legendary or divine, but don’t spend all your food/money leveling up common dragons, it’ll be somehow a waste of time/money/food.)
This game is a very challenging one, because you’ll need a lot of patience to deal with all downsides but you still can have a lot, lot of fun and play for a long time, just like me :-)"
US	5	2022-03-15	6.6.6	hello look at my report	Love	I love. This game it is never ending so many dragons!
US	5	2022-03-13	6.6.6	𝑁𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑇𝑜𝑅𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑛	Love the game! 💗	I have been having this game since 2019 or 2018. The game kept shutting off and I had to delete it, which was heartbreaking that you need to delete your favorite game. I downloaded it a several months ago, and now I have reached the Light element! And all the new dragons every week and month! It makes this game even more exciting! The game keeps my hopes up and whenever I’m down, I play this game, Dragons: Titans Uprising and Minecraft! Please check those games out!
US	2	2022-03-13	6.6.6	your master pot	Questionable	I can’t change my name and I’m trying to add a friend but it says the code is wrong. I don’t like the game because of these problems. It’s kinda boring too. At least some people like this game.. but I’m not one of those people.
US	5	2022-03-11	6.6.6	gljckhvlhviyg	Dragon mania legends	"I love this game it is really fun and entertaining but it’s starting to put adds every five minutes 
Before I didn’t do that"
US	4	2022-03-11	6.6.6	hfrSg557frr42kk86d	Mindless fun, but it plateaus out	"I’ve played this game pretty extensively for a couple months, paid very little (I did pony up for a couple things, but not much), and have had fun.  But I’ve plateaued, because when you get to a certain point (a) there’s not much reason to level up anything except the three dragons you fight with regularly, and (b) leveling those dragons becomes prohibitively expensive (in terms of food). Everything is now either simple, or impossible.

So I’m about done with it, because other than trying to breed new and interesting dragons there’s not much left I can do.  If the developers want to keep people like me (willing to occasionally spend a little money to keep having fun) engaged, they need to add some intermediate-level activities, say ones which can only be done with dragons from levels 10 - 20, or 20 - 30.  That would encourage me to go back to those mid-rank dragons who are as high as they are only because I needed the Temple level."
US	5	2022-03-05	6.6.5	kxkfrvfkbfr	I miss this game!!	I remember when I was 5 my 10 year old cousin was always playing this on his ipad, I kept peeking and he let me try it. It was pretty good. I downloaded it on my ipad to play it anytime. I literally enjoyed battling and collecting dragons, (feeding them was my favorite part) and now when I come to this, it gives me a rush of nostalgia. I miss the good old days 👍 Overall it’s an AWESOME game! Edit: I really like the music, it’s really relaxing. I would like if you had a nighttime map at nighttime-that would fit the music
US	5	2022-03-03	6.6.5	Bossgamer8988989	Game issue	This game is great but you need to add a feature to cancel your breeding session but over all I will give this game a 5 out of 5
US	4	2022-03-03	6.6.5	𝑁𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑇𝑜𝑅𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑛	Really good and really inappropriate	I saw a porn in your ad. Also one lady in there had inappropriate clothes for years 17-
US	1	2022-03-01	6.6.5	CoD Fan47	Don't install. Crash city	How do you destroy a game in one update?? Release a game without testing it. This was a good game but with the June update it crashes all the time. The dragons don't want to fight you, their new campaign you cannot win if your a new player, you are trying to fight dragons 10 -15 levels beyond you. I know it's a pay to win game, but make it fun. I restarted the game 8 times already today because of ad crashes and game just locking up. To many times I loss all my progress and had to start over, but It took away my energy bar so I had to wait to do it later. It thinks you loose wifi but my wifi is good, except this game. It does not know how to cloud sync. Not a lot of fun right know.  Guess what I updated my Ipad thinking my old one was the problem.  Still is crash city.  Freezes up in battle in the area, chests don’t open.  Beautiful art work in the game but the tech guys have no clue what they are doing.
US	5	2022-03-01	6.6.5	Blackholefive	Awesome!	Played before, but could you  make to whenever the app restarts, it saves progress? Oh! And evolutionary forms!
US	3	2022-03-01	6.6.5	puppy and dragon fan	Really?	This is a knockoff of dragon city. But I got to say, the graph is are ok. It’s a little original. But mostly just a ripoff. Maybe make something a little more original? The thing that makes me know instantly it’s an knockoff is the name. Dragon mania legends? Just try something more original next time please. But it’s better than the ripoff I saw of seven eleven called seven twelve. So congratulations making it not THAT bad.

US	4	2022-02-09	6.6.0	lolonature	It’s great! but…	So, I recently made a new account on here since I got a new iPad, I was thinking, “oh man I really missed this game! Maybe I should buy something like coins, just to give them a tip, luckily I didn’t. I changed my mind because there are so many adds! It’s like man never mind! They don’t deserve it. Overall, if the adds where gone I think it would be a better profit for them.
US	5	2022-02-08	6.6.0	ddin10	Cool game	This game is so fun cookie run kingdom i finish it that’s why I don’t play it anymore but I still play it tho but this is a hole next level but there is two things I want like a new thing you can put on your dragon i when your dragon dies it will activate and it will  back with 999 health and a new element it ice that all

US	5	2022-02-04	6.6.0	𝔾𝔸𝕝𝕚𝕩𝕪𝕡𝔸𝕟𝕕𝔸𝟙𝟚𝟘𝟟	Needs just 2 improvements and my experience of the game	"The reasons it needs improvement:
So I luv the game and it’s my go to game when I am bored or something like that but I am at max habitats for most habitats that I need such as fire wind earth and water I now gotta upgrade my habitats that I have so I can have more dragons cuz like everyday I am breeding them and getting new eggs. It takes so many hours to hatch an egg or breed the dragons or to use the academy if the dragon is not the first few dragons you get at the start of the game if it just like the fire dragon or wind dragon it won’t take that long it take like 2 mins but if it like the agent one it takes a while the earth ones don’t take that long ether about like 4 mins and the smoke dragon and bee dragon take around 5 to 8 mins.

My experience:
So I started out with first few dragons you get and habitats and farm I started to bread them and do battles and blah blah so like most games you start out slow which I did but I catches up pretty fast. I have had this game for about like 5 months and I have enjoyed it till I now have max habitats I can only get the plant habitat but anyway it is a really fun game.

An idea for an update:
So my idea is that everyone can make a dragon design and the top 20 or 15 will have there designs as a new dragon! And the players who have there ideas as a new dragon they get there dragon for FREE they also get 20k coins 

Overall it is really really good and it is not hard to play and it’s pretty cool how you can breed and hatch dragons.Thanks for reading and have a wonderful day/night/morning/afternoon"

US	5	2022-02-01	6.6.0	Stockbie	DML is the best but these can help	So far, DML is a pretty great game just some pointers. First, please make gems WAY easier to get please . I’ve played for a year and still don’t have the hatchery upgraded so please fix that. Also, could you also make events longer( I’m not talking about daily rewards)thank you. There’s nothing else that need to be fixed except the ads, they begin randomly so fix that plz thank you :)

US	3	2022-01-30	6.6.0	werkinmtmed	Love the game hate the adds	"Honestly, I’ve had this game for years and I have loved it the whole time. There are always things to do and lots of variety within the game. 

My problem is with the adds. I get multiple pop up adds within 15 mins of game play.  Sometimes I won’t even be able to play for more than 5 mins uninterrupted. 
My friend has the game also but she hardly ever gets adds. 
It’s just lame. 

Alsooo the volume control in the game doesn’t control the adds. So when they pop up so does the horridly loud and obnoxious music. So I hate that."

US	2	2022-01-27	6.6.0	Fuzzballoon	Bug	There is an add that keeps popping up and it glitches the game so every time it pops up you have to exit the game. I think it should be looked at if you have time.

I keep having to exit out of the app delete the tab and go back and even then it’s still not working if you can please get this fixed
US	1	2022-01-26	6.6.0	Not the best app but it's ok	Stop the Smoking Ads	I love this game. I play it with all of my heart. My issue is the ads. I’m fine with ads. The game just got a little trigger happy with them, which I can deal with. The problem is, the new smoking ad they put in the game whenever you exit a menu is highly infuriating. Not only can I not exit from said ad, but when you play the game and get to the end, YOU STILL CANT EXIT. You can either replay or go to a website with more facts on it. I love this game. I seriously do. But when I cannot play a level of the dragon battle because everytime I enter the fighting portal I get that ad, that is when I’ve had enough.
US	4	2022-01-26	6.6.0	King Richard IV	The stupid ads	I keep getting the REAL COST advertisement, but every time I click the X, I get a notification that says I will be unable to claim the reward. What reward! I didn’t click anything to get a reward! I just want to get back to the game! Fix this stupid bug, or get rid of the REAL COST ad.
US	3	2022-01-25	6.6.0	zavervp.	Why so many ads	I don’t know about y’all but when I used to play this there weren’t any ads at all now I can’t even take one of my dragons to the academy without a ad popping up and glitching my game
US	5	2022-01-24	6.6.0	𝑁𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑇𝑜𝑅𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑛	Good game! Some suggestions	So cool how you can get service! I wanna suggest things first… so. Maybe you could play as some dragons in a different world with other people in it, and you can talk to them! Another one- could you pay gold for gems? Like 500k for 10 gems. But make the dragon prices hire because then it would be kind of too easy to get stuff.
US	4	2022-01-24	6.6.0	😁🌈🌈🥣🍪😁🍫	So good but…🙊🙊🙊 problems!	"This game is super good and one of my favorite games but there are some problems. 
(1 Time I don’t have all day to wait for eggs to hatch, food to harvest and blah blah blah. I have a 30 minute timer and then after that timer I have to put the phone down so, can you shorten the time without having to spend gems?(do you understand what I’m saying?)
(2 OMG the prices are so high! The prices for gems and other stuff is so high can you lower them down lower the prices $100 just for some stupid gems?! I don’t get it why did the prices have to be so high. 

Thank you have a nice day and fix these problems! ^_^"

US	5	2022-01-19	6.6.0	$tbone03	Things that should be changed!	I would like to be able to buy another hatchery instead of just being able to upgrade it. I would also like a coin option to upgrade things instead of just needing gems, I don’t want to put real money into the game for gems so can you make more ways to collect gems? Also I don’t like the whale with the lady and the guy spent 99 gems to get 3 puzzle pieces for a dragon and it wasn’t specific that I was only getting 3 puzzle pieces so can y’all make it more clear on what you are buying? Other than that the game is all around amazing favorite game to play!

US	2	2022-01-19	6.6.0	abc123abcALLY	Read This Before Download	First- the ad for it is a total scam! There’s no photo-scan thingy!!! I do like the app, but the dragons are all off of 4 main bases which doesn’t make it that fun to get new dragons. I feel like the food is very limited and you have to pay for about everything! I would definitely prefer Dragon City above of this. I’m not giving it a one star because it’s not THAT bad, but it’s pretty boring.

My only complaint is that Dragon Mania has SOOO MANY ADDS!!!! It makes me SO frustrated when I am in the middle of a super fun section and ANOTHER add pops up! (And sometimes they are inappropriate) PLEASE CHANGE!

US	5	2022-01-18	6.6.0	MadiDearest	DragonML	This game is amazing. I absolutely love it. There is no way you could possibly get bored. There are plenty of things to do on this game. Love the variety of dragons. The islands are a little expensive, but with enough dragons producing gold, it shouldn’t be too hard.
US	5	2022-01-18	6.6.0	HARPER!!!!😘	Can we cancel eggs?	I accidentally pushed hatch on an egg and it went to the hatchery and it said it would take a day, I didn’t want to hatch it but I would now have to wait a day! And to upgrade the hatchery it takes a lot of gems and I don’t have that much. So maybe can there be a button to cancel the eggs? But still, this is a really good game.

I had a ton of good dragons and even more limited time legendaries as well as just regular limited time dragons. If you can give me my progress back, I would REALLY appreciate it and it would actually make me play the game again.

US	5	2022-01-10	6.5.1	Animal lover 🤍💗	Love this game!!!!	If you love dragons or just animals in general this game is perfect for you!!! This is a fun dragon game where you can breed, battle, train, hatch and probably more. I have only been playing this for a day, but my friend recommended this and I love it!! I will only say that it is very difficult to friend each other otherwise it is an age appropriate fun game!
US	1	2022-01-09	6.5.1	XxKittyLoafxX	Customer Service Is Lazy	"The customer service reps are lazy. When you bring to their attention issues, bugs and improvements you would like to see they always brush off their players with statements such as, “this is the way the game works” or “there is no issue here because this will happen for reason x, y, z” but then the reps are WRONG. 

After going back and forth and showing screen recordings multiple times, then they decide to do their jobs and report it to the developers to fix. From dragons not being able to be moved out of habitats, to event issues, the word filtering and more. As a player who has been with the DML community for 6 yrs, it’s as if the players know more about the game then the reps at this point. 

Understandably, these people are hired to field tickets created by users and may not be as familiar with it as the user/player but it would be great if your customer support reps actually took the time to investigate situations instead of brushing players off. I’ve had so many wrong replies to concerns raised lately that it seemed more useful to come here instead of reaching out to support. Do better DML."

Unfortunately, after I had to stop using my grandma’s tablet to play it when I was 11, I completely forgot about this game. But, I just remembered it this morning, and downloaded it on my new phone. I still love it. I’ve been playing it all morning

US	4	2022-01-03	6.5.1	Just_aRandomSussyBakaaaa	It’s a pretty good game, but….	"Hii I like this game a lot but I have some feedback: The dragons shouldn’t be so expensive 😐 I used to play on a kindle, and everything was A LOT cheaper, which I don’t really understand… Secondly, The breeding and hatching and stuff take a reaaally long time to hatch, the farther along you get in the game. Other than that, the game is SO GOOD.
UPDATE- Ok so I don’t know when I made my last review- but I have some thing to add. When your breeding finishes, it says like “your boiling dragon is ready for the nursery!” I liked it when I got the surprise of seeing what I got when I sent the egg to the nursery, so I think this should be removed.
That’s all I’ve got to say for now, happy holidays :)"

US	1	2021-12-27	6.5.1	Dicriti	Pay to Win	This really is a pay to win game with ads thrown in your face every 30 seconds. I fell into the trap and paid for some, but it is SO expensive. I’m not talking $1-5 items, like $20-100. Stay away. Not to mention, the ads that they have you watch for time reduction and special prizes often don’t reward you with what you’re supposed to get. They don’t care.

US	5	2021-12-20	6.5.1	norma jaan	Great game!	I’ve been playing this game for a few days now and so far it is great! It is a nice game for when you feel bored. I love how you can breed all sorts of dragons and get these unique dragons. They are just animated but when they are babies they are adorable! If the creator of the game is reading this just know that this is a great game. I would recommend it.
US	3	2021-12-19	6.5.1	shy Stuff	Habitats	I have been playing for awhile now and the biggest drawback I have with this game is it does not give you enough options to level up faster. I have dragons waiting to be placed into habitats that I can;t place because I am at maximum habitats and you don’t level up fast enough to get more. It has become very irritating to me. Please give more things to do to make this happen

Not to mention, the ads that they have you watch for time reduction and special prizes often don’t reward you with what you’re supposed to get. They don’t care."

US	5	2021-12-14	6.5.0	fluffy griffen	Can you add this dragon!	I had a great dragon idea! The new year star dragon event! But, I didn’t search the whole game, so if this already happened, it’s ok. But maybe. Sorry I was so negative in the last review, it turns out my old iPad had a problem in it so yeah, sorry about that. Anyway, I love the animation on the dragons, it is spot on! But anyway, if you liked the idea, please right a response back. Bye!
US	4	2021-12-13	6.5.0	Just_aRandomSussyBakaaaa	It’s a pretty good game, but….	Hii I like this game a lot but I have some feedback: The dragons shouldn’t be so expensive 😐 I used to play on a kindle, and everything was A LOT cheaper, which I don’t really understand… Secondly, The breeding and hatching and stuff take a reaaally long time to hatch, the farther along you get in the game. Other than that, the game is SO GOOD. JUst got the Tower dragon, so ima go play and party 🎉 have a good dayyy
US	1	2021-12-13	6.5.0	Jennerp8791	Very flabby and basically an ad	"Takes….
Forever….
To….
Load…..

Ratio of game play to ads seems to be 1-2. You open the game and go to do a single activity and you’re hit by an ad that you need to x out of four times before you get there. 

On the plus side, it’s not terribly had to get gems, because you can volunteer to watch more ads, which are quite long.  

Make sure to put your phone on silent if you like to listen to podcasts, otherwise it’ll be turned off every two minutes for yet another ad."
US	1	2021-12-12	6.5.0	LijnMom	Ruined a great game with excessive ads	Loved this game when I played it a few years ago. Downloaded it today and the ads are never ending. I would definitely pay for ad free but it’s not an option. I can’t and won’t play something with so many ads.

US	1	2021-12-06	6.4.2	Why?1495	DO NOT BUY!!! OVER RATED!!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️	This game is horrible, garbage the reviews are complete lies. Every thing is extremely difficult and overpriced. For example a event for a dragon not even that great without food and items that would be super hard to get might require you to play 24/7 or pay hundreds of dollars. This game shouldn’t be bad just for me but for everyone so don’t listen to the other positive reviews unless you need to get rid of a couple thousand dollars. Shouldn't a games purpose be to be fun and entertaining? If so the developers are completely missing out on this games real potential probably because they only care about money and not their players. This game is literally the most expensive and difficult game I’ve ever seen

US	1	2021-12-03	6.4.2	theodorthina	Good game gone to Trash	"I used to play this game a few years back and loved it!! It was fair and you could get around well without having to spend so much money or none at all. 
Now it's terrible I hate it! 
I get ads every what seems to be five minuites. You barely get coins and you have to resort to basically buying gems to even play the game and have fun how it used to be. It seems the game is just one big store now there's ads on the game telling you to buy buy buy and it's insanely over priced! 
Breeding dragons is a pain, back then I could get a good dragon on a couple breeds with a few days of playing now it seems the only way to get one is to upgrade your dragons which cost a lot of coins and basically means you can either wait and save up which takes a while or spend money which is what they want you to do. 
I understand games are to make profit but the game is not even enjoyable unless your a die hard fan who Can waste lots of money. 
They also have contests where you can spend as much gems as possible for the chance to win a dragon how is that even fair? It's basically them saying whoever has more money gets colored pixels it's not even centered around skill. 
Overall a disappointment of a game it's garbage and shows how greedy companies are GARBAGE"

US	5	2021-11-29	6.4.2	ElisabethVibes	Obsessed with this game!	I need to start by sharing that I never leave reviews for game apps. But I need to leave one for this game! The design / aesthetic is beautiful, I absolutely LOVE how many times you can win coins and food (in my opinion the more often that people can win in a game the more addicting and the longer you want to play bc it’s like an endorphin rush!) the dragons are also so beautiful and I love how easy it is to re arrange your island with the habitats and all that. 10/10 ⭐️!!!! Thank you!
US	4	2021-11-28	6.4.2	Bhored8	Please remove the constant ads	The game is literally based off of ads man. I don’t want to open the game and see an ad. I would enjoy opening and playing. I close the game more if I see a ad it is really fustrating.

US	2	2021-11-18	6.4.2	duffy the fluffy	Money Hungry	The game is fun but you can only get far into the game if you spend money. ALL they want from you is money. Some ads out in game are super long and pop up randomly. Sometimes the ad doesn’t load. It’s not my internet, it’s the ad itself. I really wish I like this game more. But I see why people don’t play it. On another note, enemy sigils are way too good. The evasion always triggers on ememies

US	4	2021-11-04	6.4.2	Bobby_T.08	Good game	Dragon Mania Legends is a great game, I have played this game for over 5 years. The game never makes you bored and it is very friendly and fun. One thing gets me a little frustrated is that, when I first had this game I had so many cool things, then I had to change my phone and nothing was there. I was upset but I realized that I didn’t back my phone up. The same thing happened just 1 and a half years later, I had even cooler things and had so much data but it did not save, and that time I had my phone backed up. I tried again and had so many cool dragons and was at a high level, I thought that this error was going to be changed until, when I switched to the phone I have currently once again, nothing was saved. This is a very nice game but I am afraid that the same thing will happen when I switch my phone again. Anyways I hope this error gets fixed because overall, this is a fantastic game!

US	1	2021-10-26	6.4.0	Jojoiko	Horrible customer service	I love the game. But the customer service is horrible. I purchased a promotional gem pack and was credited the incorrect amount.

Needless to say I won’t be spending a dime on this game any more.

I got new phones and wanted a way to save their game but my iPhone version did not have a way to connect to Facebook. I tried for days to find a way. But to no avail. I then had to delete it and start over on my new phone. My boys were heart broken that they lost all of their dragons. So I am trying once again to find a way to connect my account to gameloft or Facebook so that I can have a way to never lose their dragons again. Will you guys please fix the iPhone issue or tell me how to fix this problem. I have tried contacting you via the wiki page, Facebook page and through the game. No one is caring to respond and it is very frustrating. I would gladly spend money on this game for my boys if I new I would never lose it. Thank you.

I really wanted to play if it was that kind of game cuz thats unique. So I wasted time downloading it just to find out that you breed dragons. Great.. if you have such a great game idea in the ad, why not use that to create the game that’s shown in the ad?? Like, I just don’t understand

US	1	2021-10-03	6.3.2	09737572264	Won’t let me open the app	Lately I’ve been having issues with the app kicking me off of it but no I can’t even open it. I would delete it and download it back again to see if that fixes it but I don’t want to lose my progress
US	4	2021-10-03	6.3.2	reeee_woof	Fun	An overall really good game engaging, however somethings in the game seem to be worth a few more (in-game) coins than they should be. But besides that it’s a great game and I suggest that you check it out. 😁

US	2	2021-09-25	6.3.2	tkrenzert	Mixed bag	"I like the game but the ads are poorly executed.  Randomly popping in during game navigation without warning.  When you ask for an ad to get a reward that’s fine those work fairly well. But it’s obnoxious to be taken to a web browser then before you can stop it the App Store. Now I’m completely out of the game and have to go through multiple steps to get back.  

More than once I’ve considered uninstalling it because the ads are obnoxious. Obviously not there yet."

US	1	2021-09-14	6.3.2	Kalhoonie	Has potential, but  won’t deliver	This could be a fun game, but it’s ruined by excessive ads, having to make in-app purchases to get anywhere in a reasonable amount of time, and all the clutter. There’s ads for in-app purchases everywhere and several different quests that are all very similar in concept that make the interface/landscape look and feel cluttered. I kept it for like a week but then deleted it. Wasn’t worth 10 mins of game play a day then having to wait hours for things to hatch or regenerate.

US	1	2021-09-10	6.3.2	Misinformed12	The Ads are horrendous!	The game would be awesome if I didn’t have an ad pop up from the Ap store ever 5 mins, in some cases more frequent. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME unless you like ads. You spend more time trying to avoid them or letting them pass then you do playing the game. Again GET RID OF THE RANDOM AD POPUPS. it’s killing your game.

That happens and I love this game but
they won’t go away I’ve tried letting them load but they never do"
US	5	2021-08-25	6.3.0	chikaboomma	Great!	"I love the game! There are a lot of things to do, my favorite ones are battling and breeding, the other activities are good too! But some problems… 
1) ads sometimes pop up at random times which is terrible and annoying.
2) When I watch an ad for a reward, sometimes the game gets glitchy or I can’t close the ad! (Sometimes I lose the reward)
3)Some timers are way too long. For example, I bred a herophant dragon and the breeding time was 1 d 14h, ridiculous… the hatching timer was 2d! TOO MANY LONG TIMERS!
4) Earning enough collectors score to open the final lesson for my dragons is hard! Maybe it could be easier? Because I have to fight with dragons that have special effects that are too strong, so make it a little easier.
5) sometimes when I play battles I just stare at the screen and nothing happens when it’s my opponent’s turn! 
Thanks for reading I hope you fix mainly the first three problems! I still  💕/love your game!"

US	2	2021-08-21	6.3.0	HarlieD	Lots of fun, but…	Love playing this game! Was having lots of fun for about a month, then ads started popping up constantly. There are plenty of chances to watch lots of ads during the game, so why are they forced on me at other times? If I could play in peace, I would happily give 5 stars, but since the ads have been forced on me, interrupting my momentum & gameplay, it’s not so fun anymore. I’m constantly shutting down the game to avoid the ads. I can’t play, you don’t deserve to get paid.

US	1	2021-08-16	6.3.0	red ferrari 8365	Too many HIG nonconforming ads	The ads are a level of obnoxiousness that’s causing me to delete the app. There are video ads that start playing while you’re selecting menu items. These ads do not conform to the Apple Human Interface Guidelines—if I have my phone on silent they’ll still blast audio. When I close them, they’ll still continue playing audio. When I lock my phone, they still play. Incredibly disruptive to an otherwise fun game that’s balanced and doesn’t require payment, but skips some of the grind. There’s no way to stop these mid roll ads even if you pay.

Once I started play I automatically felt like I’m playing Dragon city 😒 putting the fire dragon in its habitat then feeding it!

I really was looking forward to making different dragons of my choice than just picking a dragon on the list to create and level up it’s an EXTREMELY PLAYED OUT TYPE OF GAME THATS ALREADY BEEN CREATED YEARS AGO!

Y’all really need to stop with the Fake/False advertising it’s so annoying."

US	2	2021-07-26	6.2.0	Duckingtiger	Big problem	Okay so I enjoy the game. It’s interesting and fun but there is one huge problem. The constant crashing. The game will run for a minute or 2 and then shut down and will need restarting.

It started out real fun because the food to feed the dragons were very low but as you make the dragons go up in level you’re losing out on more food. It’s not worth it

US	3	2021-07-21	6.2.0	Savage8809	Kinda a ripoff	so i get this game and it is really cool, i won’t deny that. but there are these don’t smoke ads for rewards. but when it is over you don’t get your prize. so that is one rating star gone. also the gems are WAY to hard to get and you have to pay buttloads of gems to do anything. for instance upgrading the hatchery takes a frickin 150 gems. and even if you got all the gems i spent together you wouldn’t even get half as much. Also about the smoking ads. for pities sake i am only ten. do you think i am going to smoke?! overall good game but plz fix those issues as soon as possible and i will give ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

US	1	2021-07-19	6.2.0	Skuddog	WHATS WITH ALL THE ADS?!?!?	Who was the idiot that thought it would be a good idea to make u watch ads just for moving between your buildings?!? Literally every two minutes you’re watching an ad, regardless of what your doing!!!! I get watching ads to get bonus loot and things. But not just closing out of a building screen going back to main map!!!! I just started playing this because my son started playing it on his fire tablet. Guess I won’t be spending a single penny on a game that cares more about you watching ads than playing the actual game. Oh and btw, none of these ads pop up on the fire tablet either. So glad to know it’s just that you really dislike us iOS peeps.

US	5	2021-07-17	6.2.0	anferlynn	Nice	Good game
US	2	2021-07-16	6.2.0	Dion of Elron	CONSTANT ADs	"The game has great potential but you have to constantly watch ads. While there is the choice of watching an ads for a small amount of loot, I am speaking of constantly having to watch ads when you go into any of your buildings or while you leave a building. Additionally, when you are trying to battle.

This developer is loosing money in attempt to get money. I am a long time Clash of Clans player and they are make millions on extras without one ad. 

Developers you have ruined this game!"
US	3	2021-07-16	6.2.0	stomtran	Too many Pop-up advertising	Every few minutes advertise pop-up. Won’t play this game for long
US	5	2021-07-16	6.2.0	Reviewer person July	So many ads + Glitched and laggy	Issue 1: 70% of your time will be spent watching ads instead of actual gameplay. (Not to mention each ad is 30-60 seconds long) Issue 2: Most of the time you won’t receive the reward you watched the ad for. After watching the ad the screen will freeze then turn completely black and the only way to get it to return to normal is to exit the game and refresh it. Once you log back in you won’t receive the reward. . . . just play animal restaurant or something :/

US	5	2021-07-12	6.2.0	chubalub5678	Great game but it needs a few tweaks.	I love the game and I’ve been playing it since It came out. I love the campaign, arena, and the clan events but there are too many ads “but it’s a free game so I understand that too” but it’s so annoying that whenever I exit something a random ad pops up, I’m fine with watching an ad to get something but not when they are random. I also don’t like how some but not all of people who buy their way into the game are always at the top of the leaderboard but if you don’t fix it it’s good I just don’t like the ads. Otherwise the game is great and my sister age 8 and friends play it with me age 11 have a great time! If you read this I hope you look into my suggestions! Bye! 😁😁😁
US	1	2021-07-12	6.2.0	Felwickid	Is not worth it	If you begin play it hits game using an iPad or iPhone stop now, any apple products do not keep up with the updates. Do not spend any real money on the game, the IT support is worthless, they will not help you.
US	4	2021-07-11	6.2.0	Zelxhich	Arena problems	Okay so all in all, I love this app! I love collecting dragons and battling with them. I have no complaints there. The only thing I’m upset about is the arena. For the past few days, I’ve only had level hard options, and I know I can’t take them on, so I keep refreshing (sometimes resorting to gems I’ve worked hard for!) and I can’t get so much as a medium opponent! I have lost time and gems trying to get an opponent I can fight, and I just haven’t. I’m not sure if this is a glitch or if I’m just extremely unlucky, but either way can I suggest a solution? What if, since there are three opponents to chose from, one of them is always easy, one medium, and one hard? If you defeat the opponent (or lose for that matter) the slot for that opponent is replaced by the same difficulty level. Just an idea, and I do love this game, I’m simple very frustrated and dissatisfied with the arena. Thank you for your time!
US	5	2021-07-10	6.2.0	Jakeninjapro662	Review of Dragon Mania Legends	What I have to say about this game is that it’s just super fun you can fight in a arena and keep feeding your pets so they can get stronger this game is just the best game I have ever played

US	5	2021-07-06	6.2.0	tjamesoforhap-hap-happy	If you’re bored install this	This is the perfect time waster I can hardly do my chores around the house because I am too focused on this game I’d do you only read it four stars because well it takes too long for a trade it be cut down a tree takes too long to be cut down that’s not the only thing it takes too long for the breeding I want to have a new dragons but it takes a while but it’s worth it when you get the dragon it’s just that it takes a while to regenerate everything and it just takes too long on the timers and stuff and I don’t like it I don’t like it one bit that’s the reason it’s only getting four stars but it’s still a great game if you’re patient I’m just really not patient but there’s nothing wrong with this game it’s just that I’m not patient and I can’t wait for anything so it’s a great game please install if you are bored and you need a time waster or if you just want a good game to play if you’re reading this review you are an amazing person and have a great day evening or night or morning whichever it is where you are

US	4	2021-06-30	6.2.0	Aim-D	Love the game, except for one thing.	This game is fun, the graphics are good, and the variety of things to do are great.   This would definitely be my game of choice if GameLoft would lose the pop up ads.  I don’t mind the ads you can choose to watch for gems or other rewards, but the random pop ups at random times disrupt my thoughts on what I want to do next.  I would even be willing to pay a small fee for a “no pop up ad” experience.  Please consider!
US	4	2021-06-29	6.2.0	stormie and Ally are the best	Good game but…	Don’t get me wrong, I love this game but once you start getting higher levels breeding dragons is difficult because of the habitats. If you already have the maximum amount of habitats then you can’t place the dragons! Also you can’t upgrade the habitats to higher levels. On the other side, this game is very fun intel it’s not 😌 I have enjoyed this game a lot. But like every game it has ads. I wish that the producers could cut out some of the ads.

US	4	2021-06-29	6.2.0	kdkosoao	Challenges	"Now I don’t right reviews this offend but I think this deserves it. Can the developers make it so you can have more than one hatchery? I’m not sure if I’m the only one with this problem but it’s a real problem for me because I have been playing for I solid few hours and it’s just mind blowing to have to wait there for hours on end for an egg to hatch while your other dragons took 30 seconds to mate but your egg is hatching for 3-4 hours with one hatchery!! It’s just an annoying feature.

Thanks for your regards

US	4	2021-06-28	6.2.0	sunuvarob	very amazing but could use some tweaking	i honestly love this game and i play it all throughout the day and it doesn’t get old. and i love dragons which makes it even better. however, there are some features i don’t appreciate that much. my biggest complaint is the food situation. the food costs so much money (like 1,000 to get about 200 pieces of food) and you barely get any food. this is mostly a problem when i have to level up my dragons so i can win the fights but theres NEVER enough food. the dragons i battle are up to level 15 and im stuck at 10 because i cant get enough food. and a lot of stuff costs way to much. why should removing a tree in a swamp cost $90,000?? those are my biggest complaints.
US	2	2021-06-27	6.2.0	Miss Kristi	What’s with all the ads???	I used to play this game daily. I loved collecting all my little dragons and feeding, leveling, battling, but lately when I log in, it’s ad after ad. I only have about 10 minutes to play each time I log in, so a 30 second ad every time I try to complete a clan quest,or pet  dragons makes me able to do less, which means I spend more time on here watching ads than actually playing, which means I have only logged in once this month because it’s exhausting. And I JUST logged in, went to my clan, tried to pet dragons for the clan, and got an ad. So here I am instead of playing because I’m so so tired of the ads. Can you tone it down?
US	5	2021-06-27	6.2.0	User5736903	Good for kids	On iPhone, ads are appropriate for kids and keeps it free to play.
US	2	2021-06-26	6.2.0	OkayGamerBlog	Want some game with your ads?	This game has the potential to be super fun - lots of engaging material, super cute dragons that you can interact with, storylines - but I got an ad a minute. Makes it unplayable.
US	5	2021-06-26	6.2.0	matywe	Yes this game is the best cool game	Best Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
US	4	2021-06-25	6.2.0	Leonya57	Great but glitch	"I love this game… 
I like that you can grow dragons.
I like that you fight in the arena instead of puzzles like in all the other games.
I like how you can expand and level up.
But I got a glitch which is stopping me. The glitch is that the game is telling me that I have used all of my metal habitats when I actually never even placed one yet. 
So if someone knows that this isn’t a glitch or someone who can fix, pls help."
US	5	2021-06-25	6.2.0	horrible do not cant even	I like it	Can you pls change the 3 hours Bc I hate that btw games fine do
US	1	2021-06-25	6.2.0	Sorcia	Arena/enchanted league merge terrible	"I have played this game for years and put in lots of money to now be stopped in my tracks.  My dragons are level 65 and am getting paired against dragons level 100. Almost all battles are hard level with no choice to play a medium or easy.  Even one daily free refresh doesn’t help. No way to win, even with gems.  So no more enchantment mats to continue to raise my dragons.
Please undo the arena / enchanted league merge! Otherwise this game and all of the money I have put in is gone.  Most of the games I play are gameloft but I can change that…I am retired and have the money to spend and even so, spending gems does not allow me to move forward. Your response to this will be the game changer…literally."

US	5	2021-06-24	6.2.0	Darkkkar	Way better than Dragon City	"Ello thar~

I think I have played this game to much in the past week-ish.
Playing it and going back on Dragon City, this is SO MUCH DANG BETTER. If you have played Dragon City and you kinda liked it, most likely u will like this more.

Reasons:

-Less cluttered
-Better art
-Just better gameplay
-Easy to navigate
-Not to many ads (Still has ads)
-Other cool features

If you prefer Dragon City, that’s you and I don’t agree. The only reason I’m putting this here is because Dragon City won’t let me write a review to criticize it terribly."

US	5	2021-06-22	6.2.0	fvbbnvn	The best game	Tbh in my opinion, this game is the best game ever so fun and addicting. I can apply and get you're like a year now, and it's not boring, like its so, so funny, like, I don't know why some of these people don't like it cause I really like it, and it's a pretty good game, but it only gets 4 stars because the.eggs take long  hatch, but also it's a really fun game afterwards.

US	5	2021-06-21	6.2.0	OtterJack	Been fun forever	This is one of the first app games I ever played, now I’m on a new device and am worried I may have messed something up. I contacted support about it and they told me it was because of my country’s laws, I live in America so this shouldn’t be a huge problem. I tried a VPN and it didn’t work either. I cannot change my nickname and I have a particular distain for the generic one. I would love a feature that could be used to change your country so that you could have a username. For now I will be playing that one other generic dragon collection game. I also cannot reset it as it’s impossible to connect to social media and deleting it does nothing.
US	5	2021-06-21	6.2.0	Shroom<3	Wonderful game	This is one of the only times I’d ever write a review because this game is one of my most favorite games! You don’t need to pay and can do things without paying. It’s super fun and I would recommend.

US	4	2021-06-19	6.2.0	PersonThatLikesFoxes	One REALLY annoying part	The game is good but there is just one thing that really annoys me. When your in the dragon training sometimes even though you do the thing to make it attack it doesn’t attack also when you just miss TWO TIMES ONLY it’s an automatic fail. This is just so annoying please fix it
US	1	2021-06-19	6.2.0	pandaface098754	I am very concerned	When I was playing this game it kept asking for my location and wouldn’t stop even though I said stop DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT WILL FIND YOUR LOCATION
US	4	2021-06-19	6.2.0	Audreyacalus	Great Game but would need some changes	First of all, I LOVE THIS GAME! I love how the dragons are animated and how you can get wonderful dragons! But I would change somethings like the breeding. I am pretty sure that some people can agree with me that when you are trying to breed a new dragon and you get a duplicate that is kinda annoying, also with how long the breeding takes, it can take, well in my case a day and a half to breed a new dragon and sometimes it is not the dragon I want. I also have a complaint about how all of the better dragons you have to buy with gems when most people don’t want to spend 50 dollars on buying gems just for one dragon, also with the random ads that pop up is annoying especially when I am trying to do things in Game and same thing goes for the time skip ads. Overall I would say a great game and I love this!!

US	3	2021-06-17	6.2.0	Noraxplora09	Two things I’d like changed.	"Ok, so the first thing is prices. The GEMS. The PIECES. Almost everything in this game is overpriced. And HOW could you do that, since there’s obviously a lot of greed about this game. It’s INSANE. The other thing is, I hate when it says I can’t put any more habitats for my dragons, even though I have room.

I recommend considering my ideas. Thanks!"
US	1	2021-06-17	6.2.0	tumblleweed	Video game cancer	At one point I would have said the games made by These people were decent. They recently reworked there version of pvp. The new one if you lose it gives you the option to admit defeat, reworded as give up with a picture of a crybaby above it. The other option is to cheat and reset health to full with a picture of a strong dragon ready to fight. It’s bad enough games games let you use money to accelerate the process, now there trying to make people feel bad for not cheating. You have crossed the line. You know we only shower each day because soap companies sales were leveling out and they guilt tripped Americans into feeling like they need to shower every day. Thought the whole idea was nuts but I guess there current rateing proves that sort of thing happens. This is spilling over to Xbox , play station, and pc. I’m sick of it. I’ve played there games for years put tons of work in. I delete all of them and give them a true review now. If you are a half decent person don’t download this or any of there games, don’t support video game cancer. Insane graphics, new technology, more powerful systems and the best new games I can find are made by lone devs that get no credit because they don’t got the cash for good graphics. If you do download this game do it to give them what they deserve, a one star review that shows their true colors, greedy scam artist trying to rake in the cash for investors held together by the deceived, this is no game just a scam.

US	5	2021-06-15	6.2.0	APersonWithABlackHeart	Overall really good, just one thing	So, I’ve been playing this game since I was 5 or 6 years old. I’ve had to start over twice, but only because I had gotten a new iPad and it didn’t transfer (I don’t have an account so I think that’s why). So, in this new update (also, great job Gameloft!) I went into the arena and I get super easy opponents (this was earlier btw) and I beat them all. Well guess what? Got into the game at around 9:00 PM and I had all hard opponents. Like, the max level I can get my dragons is level 10 currently. I was getting my butt whooped by dragons within the level range of 20 - 15 dragons. I wasted all of my energy on battles I knew I wasn’t going to win. But other than that, the game is overall really fun and if you put enough time into it, I believe you can win without having to pay for it. Also, if Gameloft could make it possible to transfer the game information (idk if it is just my iPad or the game or a bug or something) to another iPad without having to have an account. I’m 11, so I’m not allowed to have any kind of social media, FaceBook included. So if you could make that possible, thanks! I know this sounds like a complaining review, but the game is really good and entertaining, especially for kids like me. That’s all for now! Bye!

US	1	2021-06-15	6.2.0	XxGamer.	Stuck	When I enter the game after that in 3 sec the game froze doesn’t work at all.
US	2	2021-06-14	6.2.0	Vineclimber3	Too Much Stuff	It’s a good game, but like almost all dragon games, has a bit too many dragons with not enough space. My main problem is that there is all these things Ican click on that lead to somewhere random, and I don’t know where anything is. This bothers me so much, I might play it more if this were to change
US	5	2021-06-14	6.2.0	kkjdjd8	This game is the best.	This game is the best because it has so many dragon and my sister started like a month ago and I have more dragons than her and I started today you could add A couple more dragons otherwise it’s the best.

US	4	2021-06-14		Noraxplora09	A couple little changes…	So, overall, really fun game! It’s cool that you can look for chronos, fight bosses, and so campaign battles. But the GREED for the GEMS. They cost WAY too much. I mean, 3,800 gems for 99.99? It’s just a waste of money. Lower the price please. You might get more people to download this app if you do. And the monthly and weekly dragon breeding outcome odds are really slim, if you could change that too.

1. Running out of features, making air it really bland
2. CAN’T GET MY 2016 ACCOUNT BACK, HAD LIKE 24 LEGENDARY DRAGONS ON THERE
3. Stop spamming emoji it’s really annoying
4. Ads..."

I want to buy dragons but they’re like 1,000 and I can only 1-3 gems at a time and I usually have to watch an add for it anyway. Plus, I want to hatch an egg and place it, “there are no available habitats for your dragon.” Ok well where/how can I buy a new habitat? I don’t freakin  know!
US	5	2021-06-09	6.2.0	TLB917	Fun	I like this game
US	4	2021-06-09	6.2.0	UNICORN_POWER🦄🦄🦄	Kinda annoying.. but love it	I love it so additive tho if can be frustrating and irritating. I like breeding but I don’t want to be stuck and held up because my egg takes a FRIKEN 19 AND A HALF HOURS TO HATCH. But it is what keeps bringing me back to play. As I said so addictive! The fun color schemes and the designs and the creative crosses is just amazing kudos to the people who came up with that. The animations are kinda fun but they can you some work and patching up, sometimes you can see the crappy like 1-3 hour work, very 2D doesn’t really bring the 3D effect too much in to it. Once you get started it is fun until you get to the middle-ish your stuck with the same profits from the Common Uncommon dragons. Desperately trying to get Rares and Epics and doing all the waiting and that crap. But once you actually nail everything down it’s good. Good game overall somethings to work on…I can see the game coming to an end and for there to be no point to keep on playing for some because you have every dragon every place, your rich in coins and gems and are a very high level and have high level dragons. Alright that’s it I am done complaining

US	5	2021-06-05	6.1.3	Noraxplora09	One medium change…	"Ok, so this is one of my favorite game on this device, so good job. The gameplay is just so fun and challenging, it really is such a great game. But if I had to change something, it would be prices.
     So, I don’t want to complain, but the cost of almost everything is overpriced, in my opinion, by the way. For example, most of the weekly and monthly dragons cost over 1,000 gems, and the first thing I though about that was, “HOW THE HECK ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET THAT MANY GEMS WITHOUT PAYING???” I really do hate to break it to the game creators, but it’s true. It’s WAY too overpriced. Just the cost of the gems, not the real money, lol. 

And hey, if you agree, copy and paste this on your review. 😉

One thing I wish you could do is gift dragons to your friends and be able to have a game chat. Another thing is that I want to have more time to get event dragons. And then what is the worst is when a random ad pops up, overall though it is the best game in my opinion I love the campaign and the arena but please look into implementing my thoughts in the game and I like the way the game is going.

P.S my little sister loves it too we are 11 and years old and she may have some thoughts."
US	1	2021-06-02	6.1.3	IceKx	You will probably lose all your progress	If you play this game and any game using the game center sign in you can’t move to another device.My level is 110, when I tried to open in my tablet, it didn’t let me .Customer support doesn't help.It is same issues with My Little Pony game Level(126).All of them  are gone .Play them if you want to waste your time and money.
US	4	2021-06-02	6.1.3	Potato chips are yummy	Fun but not perfect	"The game is fun, the mechanics are easy enough to understand, and the graphics are amazing for a mobile game. I’ve enjoyed it for years. Allows ample interaction via clan chat and a friend system for people who enjoy that.

However, the events are just too frequent and there is never any breathing time. Once one ends, the next begins. You have to constantly check and almost nobody has that kind of time. Event timers tend to refresh very early or very late depending on where you live, and it’s easy to lose some sleeping time because a new event just began. Furthermore, the large month-long events are getting more frequent, from 1 or 2 a year to one every other month. Players need time to adjust and take care of things obtained from the previous big event, having another one too soon is overkill. 

Another issue is the amount of paid content. Mobile games tend to be money hungry, and yes there are worse games, but this one is by no means relaxed. Some dragons and items are exclusive to paid packages, and advancing in the game is extremely slow without dumping a good hundred or so every so often. Especially during the big events because they always advertise “new strong event exclusive stuff”. 

My two pieces of advice: if you are looking into this game, know how much time it will eat up. If you are a gambler or play other pay to win games, I would recommend you stay away. Otherwise, go ahead."
US	5	2021-06-02	6.1.3	Mr.Cheese98	The funnest game yet	This game is so fun try to for your self it is much better than candy crush I have so many dragons you have to try this game👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
US	4	2021-06-01	6.1.3	renacuajo67	AMAZING But…	"Y’all did a fantastic job. The only problem is that every time I watch an ad to skip breeding time, get a free gem, get a dragon card, or get enchanted materials it doesn’t give me anything. I just watch an ad for nothing and it’s really annoying-and a waste of time. Please fix this glitch. 
    Other than that it’s a really great game and I highly recommend it. THANK YOU 😊 🐉"
US	3	2021-05-29	6.1.3	a u g g i e	Amazing but there is a bug	Well, when you breed two dragons, you can’t seem to get them out. Whenever you tap on it, it just says “Upgrade hatchery to breed more!” and I can’t get the dragons back out. Please fix this, but good job on your game, it’s amazing!
US	4	2021-05-29	6.1.3	WollyToe	DragonML	Nice game! To bring more people to this game maybe sponsor some of the YouTubers. That way more people here of this game. I also feel like the fighting arena would be better if people could challenge you not you just challenging other people. Otherwise, nice game keep releasing new dragons!
US	5	2021-05-28	6.1.3	Foxydough	THIS THE BEST GAME EVER	I LOVE this game it’s sooooo awesome I give it five stars i like the cute baby dragons we get name our dragons feed them pet them and even go fight another dragons but THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER and your dragons give u money I like it it’s so fun please make a new update to get a house and the creator of this game is awesome I like this game and thank you for the people who made this game
US	3	2021-05-28	6.1.3	RJL0822	Love the game, hate all the ads!!!!	Love the game but all the ads like every two seconds!! Wish I could bypass all the ads by paying like $.99 or $1.99…. If it weren’t for the 50,000 ads just while playing five minutes of the game, it would be more fun and I would wanna play more but I can’t stand the ads every single time I try to do anything in the game it takes me to an ad! I hate the ads!!!!
US	5	2021-05-27	6.1.3	Hi😁😍🥰	I love the game very very much😇	"Hi this game is so much FUN I just want a tal you🤩🤩!

US	4	2021-05-26	6.1.3	KataybeaN	It’s a really good game.	This game is really good. The dragons are amazing and all the different islands you can buy are awesome. The prices for lots of different things like habitats, upgrades, and clearing trees are a little over priced because the dragons don’t give you enough to keep up with it all but I guess that’s how the game keeps it challenging. So ya, all in all this game is amazing. Thanks to the creators of this awesome game!
US	5	2021-05-26	6.1.3	leopardgeckolover	I love dragons	And this game does a wonderful job creating unique and awesome dragons and the way that you can interact with them is just incredible
US	1	2021-05-26	6.1.3	ivynotfound	Money lovers	This game, while fun, has in app purchases that are way too overpriced. Then they have “sales” where something ( like a dragon with 200 gems bundle) was originally $65 and now it’s $10???? That’s outrageous, and $10 is still a too much.
US	5	2021-05-26	6.1.3	fish lady:)	Cool game	"I like this game. It’s pretty cool but I don’t like adds popping up in your face as soon as you open the game. That’s really all
I have to say."
US	3	2021-05-24	6.1.3	zayyking22	Review	The game is fine but I can’t recruit any friends
US	4	2021-05-24	6.1.3	DilonZ1021	Minor changes	I am really addicted to this game even though I just started playing but I wish there were more items that cost coins instead of gems. Anything useful in the game cost 100+ gems
US	5	2021-05-23	6.1.3	why don't people like Google	Awesome	This game is super fun but I but Dragon city is better what I recommend this game
US	3	2021-05-23	6.1.3	JesterandtheJets	A fun time waster, but be mindful of purchases.	"I’ve played this game since way back in the day with my old phone. It’s a great game that resembles Pokémon but with dragons. However, gems are very expensive, and some events are very misleading. Don’t buy gems if you’re in a rush to finish a event. I literally thought by the end of this one event I would be able to get a guaranteed event dragon, however I was met by a 1/15 deal where I had to open the chest 15 more times for the drake. The chest of which also too 2000 stepping stones, which if you have no gems forces you to buy 300 gems which costs 10$. So every time I opened the chest I’d have to have bought about 150$ for a dragon that’s not even legendary. Yikes. 
Otherwise the game can take you days to reach milestones or get the dragon of the week, don’t fall into the trap of buying gems to speed things along either. Just play the game when your portal recharges and eggs naturally hatch, or watch ads to speed up the process. Honestly the only reasonably thing you’d use gems for is when you’re getting fruit trees or discounted boss dragons."
US	5	2021-05-23	6.1.3	oottrreeyyuu	Fun?	"It is so asome no problems fun for dragon lovers and wings of
Fire
👍"
US	5	2021-05-23	6.1.3	DragonForce_	Great work guys🤩	Love the game. Big DML player, just wandering... could you Maybe... and I’m just suggesting ... have the dark fire dragon in the breeding monthly dragons? I love the dragon, and I love the game, all do anything to support you guys✨✨✨✨
US	1	2021-05-23	6.1.3	star1234567775434	😩😢😡	HiI really like the game at first I saw an ad for it and it looked really cool because it showed that I could take pictures of items around my house and turn them into dragons when I try going on the app it didn’t work I tried it I clicked everything but it didn’t work that’s why I’m giving this a one star review
US	4	2021-05-23	6.1.3	slug terrace	Great game	Dragon mania legends is a great game. It has different dragons gems coins and food. But ads randomly come on and it is annoying so I would like for their to be no random ads.
US	5	2021-05-23	6.1.3	unicorn prinness	It’s good but...	It’s a really fun game but I bought jems and it’s didn’t give me the gems but it stole my money☹️
US	3	2021-05-22	6.1.3	applesux91	Perfect except they don’t fix bugs	If not for this issue, I would absolutely give the game 5 stars. But as long as I have played now (a few months) the SAME problem occurs. I’ve reached out before, they said they knew about, but it hasn’t gotten better. The issue is the ads: you can watch an ad and then it takes 30 minutes off the timer for breeding/hatching eggs. It only works about 15% of the time, that is not an exaggeration unfortunately. This seems like it would be an easy fix, but it’s gone on for months and quite frankly it’s super annoying. I was not impressed with customer service when I reached out for help. She rudely said they were aware of the issue- ok, that was months ago, and nothing got better. Fix this bug and I’d gladly give 5 stars.
US	3	2021-05-22	6.1.3	and im just getting started	Really fun but an issue	Ok I’m enjoying the game quite a bit. I’ve been breeding plenty of dragons and I saw someone else suggested the ability to store eggs instead of having to put em in the nursery, I think that’s a great idea. But my MAIN issue is the fact that so far, the dragon food gets more expensive per food. An example is the first option is 5 food for 15coins. That means I’m paying 3coins per food. When you plant in bulk, that unit price goes up instead of getting better deals, it go up to even 10. Maybe it’s not that big an issue for some people but I’m always looking to maximize my progress and this bugs me. It’s still a good game and very fun so far
US	5	2021-05-21	6.1.3	Allycat907	Love Dragon Mania!	This game has so much fun and advert offer and it is always updating and bringing cool new thing to the board. Even if you can’t buy things all the time it’s possible to progress over time by just being consistent and playing what you can. I love this game and it is my relaxation after a hard day of parenting.
US	5	2021-05-21	6.1.3	zoe benevenuto	I love this game	I love breeding all the dragons it’s so fun
US	4	2021-05-20	6.1.3	penny G.W.	To expensive	Some of the deals are to expensive one is $99.99 and I’m sick off it, so the game get four stars. I like most of the game I’m glad I got it.
US	3	2021-05-19	6.1.2	Un important	The adds	I wish it didn’t show an add every time I tried to exit a place.
US	5	2021-05-19	6.1.2	nx hdi..	Lost my game data. Need a solution	I was trying to open dml but the screen was stuck on the “mapping dragonlandia” page. I tried deleting the app and downloading it again, since it helped in the past. I really love this game, there was a lot of achievements with my dragons. After the games was downloaded, I opened to see everything was reset and started the game from the beginning. I tried logging in through Facebook where I had my previous account linked to but it doesn’t work either. If there’s a solution to this, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!
US	5	2021-05-18	6.1.2	JAW_B	SO GREAT PLS DOWNLOAD	As soon as I saw this game on a app hunt I immediately downloaded it and could not get off. This game can be violent but not really. If you don’t like this app your not berry cool!!!!!
US	5	2021-05-18	6.1.2	AriYahna826	BEST GAME EVER SHOULD DOWNLOAD	This game is super fun I play this game 24/7 all of my dragons are SUPER high levels you should download this game it’s SUPER FUN and the dragons as baby’s are VERY CUTE and they are still cute when they are full grown but my opinion is that this is the best game ever not sure about yours but my family thinks that this game is really cool so try it out!
US	5	2021-05-17	6.1.2	loozieD	Dragons ML	For being the best game ever❤️❤️❤️
US	5	2021-05-17	6.1.2	CypressTx12	Love this game but I feel things	like I said, only a few things. First off about one hour and 30 minutes into the game, it was already taking about five hours just for an egg to hatch or breed. Honestly, that’s really it this is a great game and,I definitely recommend it!
US	4	2021-05-15	6.1.2	Derp. E	Good game, however there are some things	Dml is an overall good game and I love it, it is interactive and fun. The events are frequent and exciting, and the dragons have great designs. However, there is a single bug I want to address and a suggestion. The bug: I will click watch ad for a reward (mainly egg hatching) and I would watch it. But there is a small time span between the end of the ad and the notification. If I interact with anything in that span, I lose the reward. Moving on, my suggestion is something I KNOW AT LEAST 3% OF THE COMMUNITY WANTS. Trading dragons. That’s it lol thanks
US	2	2021-05-14	6.1.2	futieeen	ok this is why i hate this game	so u know why i rate it 2? because please make all the dragons coins instead of gems make them very expensive to make it fair

US	5	2021-05-12	6.1.2	ybhjnmkdfbg	Fix the food	Super fun game but when you get to a certain level you can’t get enough food for the dragons as you should. If anything they should let you feed what you have that that time not in increments. Or should be able to have more then one fruit tree. Only complaint about the game is the food situation other then that it’s fun.
US	5	2021-05-10	6.1.2	popcorn_aj	XD Elias should go to lvl 20!	THIS GAME IS SUPERB
US	4	2021-05-10	6.1.2	Danilitch	Good game but...	I love the game, but I just don’t like how there aren’t a lot of variety to easier to obtained dragons like “regular breeding” ones. The events aren’t long enough like the boss battles where you go 4 stages, and a lot of the cooler dragons are extremely difficult to obtain. Also there should be more dragons like More Tiki themed ones and Aztec.

US	4	2021-05-08	6.1.2	dogloveforcats	One problem	I love this game but there is one flaw. I was trying to speed up breeding, so I watched an ad to get gems . When I got done with the ad, y’all didn’t even give me gems so I got frustrated and stopped playing for that day. Please fix this and please make some speed ups cost coins instead of gems

US	1	2021-04-26	6.1.2	Littleleisl	Customer care as they call themselves is deplorable, Despicable and down right rude.	"I have a love hate with this game. My game has had issues since I started playing, I write tickets they do nothing. They have taken game currency from me, can’t watch videos, don’t get credit or creatures for events.  They will imply that you are a liar and some actually do call you one, even when you have screenshots to prove. They want exact time and date of issues and screen shots of unforeseen glitches and don’t accept the time and date on your screenshot and submit ticket, they also false advertise. The game intentionally does not have date and time on screen, which they always request or they can do nothing. I’ve also caught on that they change the person you deal with every time so you have to start over and they do not compensate because you were dealing with someone else.  Anytime I feel like I’m getting somewhere they switch people. I tell them look at the date and time it was sent that is when it happened. Now they tell me I need to screen shot my purchases. They are always “infallible”.
I can not express how much this game has cost me my PTSD, emotional distress, strain on my marriage, anxiety, near nervous breakdown, they won’t compensate, I still can’t empty Ottos lotto basket.  Participate in events nothing but my grandchildren love it so we share in the petting of the dragons & feeding them if I can afford to feed them 76 million coin buy it just goes on and on the issues in my game are getting increasingly worse and customer care do nothing.
I won a dragon for competing in the Arena now they say that you must have 3 dragons at level 80 to go to elite league which is the one above the league I won. l won the league 1 Arena and it clearly states it has the grand prize of the Legion dragon for winning at my level. They will not issue, I explain it is false advertising and illegal, they will not budge.
 I’d take them to court but I’m just a little person, I’d love to rally a class action lawsuit. I still want to play the game just I want it to be for me the same as for everyone else, a truly fair game.  If I have to write another ticket it will be too soon. Oh yes they ask for screenshots but refuse your email with them attached.
Then you get an email saying they haven’t heard from you in a while so things must be good this is off me writing and attaching 4-5 times a day, literally. Then they tell you this is a conversation # ID it must be included in all your emails. I do painstakingly only to receive an email stating they closed that case because I wrote to someone else when they were handling it and I put that ID# in the about line and at top of every new email I send. 
Now I have to start all over again. It would be such an amazingly fun game if it were fair and honest. I love the game but at some point something has to give. I haven’t even scratched the surface here in this review."

US	5	2021-04-24	6.1.2	OdreytheOnionseller	Best game that I have right now	"1. The Music is so so relaxing. One thing i don’t really like is that the music in the fighting campaign (idk what to call it; it’s when you enter the ancient portal and you can see the map) gets quite repetitive
2. The graphics of every single dragon are all so high-quality and beautiful. All of their animations are really smooth too. 
3. There are almost no glitches that have happened to me when playing
4. It’s not a frustrating type of game at all; it can take less than 2 weeks of playing to get 1 million gold, you can simply watch ads to spin a lottery wheel and get lots of resources, and they have lots of special deals
5. There a lots and lots of special events in the game. They are all really fun and have super cool rewards if you rank high enough.
6. One thing I don’t really like is how repetitive the ads get. It’s not really the game’s fault, though. I once got 7 of the same ads in a row when spinning the lottery wheel (ad was from “the real cost” telling people not to vape). I do sometimes get different kinds of ads mostly for mobile video games, tho. 
7. Dragon food is also quite expensive, and the dragons need to eat TONS of food. For most of the food choices in the farms, it’s a ratio of 1 food for 10 coins. You can spend 50,000 gold but only get 5000 food in return. My fighting dragons are all at level 26-30 and it takes more than 25,000 food to feed them up 1/4 of a level, meaning it’ll take around 100,000 food to just feel one dragon to the next level. You can also only have 12 farms before reaching level 60, which is means it takes more time to get food."

US	4	2021-04-24	6.1.2	crowbat35060	Fix it	DML is a good game one flaw with this new update : every time I try to log in it crashes other than that it’s a good game!
US	5	2021-04-24	6.1.2	Dragontamer14	THIS GAME IS SOOOO FUN!!!	I love this game so much because my favorite mystical animal is a dragon but there are a lot of ads so I wish there weren’t as many ads but other than that this game is so much fun.
US	5	2021-04-24	6.1.2	drangontrainer1254	COOLEST DRAGONS	Ok like you can EARN them you can BUY them and you can HATCH them and there always so cool!
US	1	2021-04-24	6.1.2	Littleleisl	Customer care as they call themselves is deplorable, Despicable and down right rude.	"I have a love hate with this game. My game has had issues since I started playing, I write tickets they do nothing. They have taken game currency from me, can’t watch videos, don’t get credit or creatures for events.  They will imply that you are a liar and some actually do call you one, even when you have screenshots to prove. They want exact time and date of issues and screen shots of unforeseen glitches and don’t accept the time and date on your screenshot and submit ticket, they also false advertise. The game intentionally does not have date and time on screen, which they always request or they can do nothing. I’ve also caught on that they change the person you deal with every time so you have to start over and they do not compensate because you were dealing with someone else.  Anytime I feel like I’m getting somewhere they switch people. I tell them look at the date and time it was sent that is when it happened. Now they tell me I need to screen shot my purchases. They are always “infallible”.
I can not express how much this game has cost me my PTSD, emotional distress, strain on my marriage, anxiety, near nervous breakdown, they won’t compensate, I still can’t empty Ottos lotto basket.  Participate in events nothing but my grandchildren love it so we share in the petting of the dragons &amp; feeding them if I can afford to feed them 76 million coin buy it just goes on and on the issues in my game are getting increasingly worse and customer care do nothing.
I won a dragon for competing in the Arena now they say that you must have 3 dragons at level 80 to go to elite league which is the one above the league I won. l won the league 1 Arena and it clearly states it has the grand prize of the Legion dragon for winning at my level. They will not issue, I explain it is false advertising and illegal, they will not budge.
 I’d take them to court but I’m just a little person, I’d love to rally a class action lawsuit. I still want to play the game just I want it to be for me the same as for everyone else, a truly fair game.  If I have to write another ticket it will be too soon. Oh yes they ask for screenshots but refuse your email with them attached.
Then you get an email saying they haven’t heard from you in a while so things must be good this is off me writing and attaching 4-5 times a day, literally. Then they tell you this is a conversation # ID it must be included in all your emails. I do painstakingly only to receive an email stating they closed that case because I wrote to someone else when they were handling it and I put that ID# in the about line and at top of every new email I send. 
Now I have to start all over again. It would be such an amazingly fun game if it were fair and honest. I love the game but at some point something has to give. I haven’t even scratched the surface here in this review."

Because there are like only 10 different dragon designs but they are still all so cute! I love this game so much! I give this game 5 stars! I hope you love it as much as I do!
US	4	2021-04-23	6.1.2	GenevieveTroup	Very fun game aside from the ads	This is a very cute game, but I feel sometimes there are just too many ads. I understand trying to make money through advertising other games and stuff but I think the experience would be much better with less ads.

US	5	2021-04-22	6.1.2	DucktheFirst	Update bug?	I really enjoy playing this game I like all of its designs and events and just the game in general, but I updated the game to the most recent update and when I went to type in the clan it tell me that I am prohibited from using chat. I never had this problem before until the update and I was wondering if that could be fixed or how can I fix that if it’s just me and not everyone?

US	4	2021-04-15	6.1.0	Michaelajk2002	Progress saving	I’m rating this game 4/5 stars only because I wish there was a way to save your progress. I’ve enjoyed this game for a few years now and every time I got a new device, I’d have to restart the entire game; which meant losing all of my magnificent dragons :( I’ve gotten farther than I’ve ever been but now I have to replace my phone and I’d like to be able to somehow save my progress. Is there any way that could happen?

US	3	2021-04-14	6.1.0	ForeverSadness	Not always good	So I was playing this game, and I was going to hatch an egg, but I didn’t have the habitat, so I went to buy it with coins. When I was going to get it it said I had 15/15 fire when I only had four. 15/15 of wind habitats when I only have one, and all the plant habitats when I didn’t have any! That means that my hatchery is full and I can’t hatch anything, and I can only get more coins to do nothing with! Other than that, the game is kind of fun, and totally addicting. But please fix this bug!
US	5	2021-04-14	6.1.0	K8Twn	A some	Dragon mania legends is super awesome gives you a real experience I’ve tried a lot of other games with dragons and I found the dragon is in my top three I love the breed it no other game except Dragon city mimics it.

US	5	2021-04-14	6.1.0	Emily Emma Lanton	There’s too much	This game was and is still amazing but There are a few things I would change.The game used to be so simple and fun, now there’s so much to the game I can’t even keep up.It’s like there’s a new update every day.This is because the app has become popular. I am ok with updates just don’t add more to the storyline or a whole nether battle area to fight in.You used to be able to fight, feed, and breed dragons.But my point is stop changing the game.And if your going to add anything just add new dragons and Islands.The people who play the game don’t need or want more.

US	4	2021-04-09	6.1.0	Kerliza	Ads and Font	I like to zoom out and see my island from a distance but the text gets too big when I do and I can barely see my habitats or things on the island that need clearing. Also the pop up ads are annoying. I’ll be in the middle of something and an ad will just pop up. I get the need for ads but when I’m playing and ads constantly interrupt my game play, I lose interest. It’s one thing to watch an ad for a reward but totally another to have it pop up and have to wait at least 15 seconds for the option to leave the ad.

US	1	2021-04-09	6.1.0	SunnyDragon!	Monotony. Disappointed I:(	The whole part of ‘’breeding’’ makes me uncomfortable. Dog breeding is awful and so it is to cats. There are already enough animals in the world that need help. I rarely play this game. The new update is weird, too. The icon for it is really odd and soft looking. Kind of mad that you changed it. Also, I am dragon obsessed, but I feel like this kind of missed the mark. The battles are continuous and monotonous.

We were soo sad and we never got it again! But I am going to give it another try because I removed loving it so much!!!

US	4	2021-04-07	6.1.0	maryyram88	Dragon Mania Legends	I really enjoy this game I had it a few years ago and I can say when I downloaded it the time they have fixed a LOT of the problems they had when I first had it in 2017. One of the problems I had before that they fixed was easier time backing up without Facebook. I didn’t start playing again until last year because my phone broke before I could figure out how to back up my game leaving me with no other choice but to start over. Also they have many options to watch advertisements for prices but they still have constant ads, which is very irritating. I believe if they had fewer ads I would get lost in the game more and spend more time on it. But with constant interruptions I just want to get off because I start to realize how much time I’m wasting. But other than that I really enjoy it.
US	4	2021-04-07	6.1.0	Jjhooks	Please read	I really love this game and I play it with my little brother, but I have a few suggestions.  First, make the name limit longer.  Instead of 1-6 characters, maybe have 1-12 or something.  Second, make it so that I can change my name.

US	4	2021-04-06	6.1.0	alex 300989908	I love this game but	This is an amazing game to play I love it! But one thing is kanda annoying it takes sooo long for eggs to hatch and to finish the cave exploring. So pls fix it at least make it about 30 minutes. Thank you!
US	4	2021-04-06	6.0.0	Blouise19	Fun but could be better	The pop up ads are very VERY annoying, just increase the amount of diamonds you can get from watching videos and you won’t need to have so many pop ups. The time it takes to do anything is ridiculously long, a decrease in time lengths will help keep us engaged and get us farther sooner. Also can you make the name letter amount be more than six characters? With all the negativity out of the way, I really love the variety of dragons and how cool and adorable they are. I love collecting them and naming them and I like all the different interactions that are available. I think the battles are really fun and the events are really unique with cool prizes to win. I enjoy this game a lot and I know I would love it even more if these fixes could be made. PLEASE!

I’ve recently upgraded to an Apple 8 and tried to log back into my game save (that I’ve sighed into on Facebook) and once I log into my Facebook the data does not sync and it brings me back to level 18... I am on level 56 and I feel awful. I had reached over 100 dragons. Please fix this, I want to make in-app purchases but I refuse to pay for anything on this older account. I’ve already given my old phone away to a friend and I can’t get it back. I don’t know what to do, I love this game a lot please fix this issue or I’ll have to discontinue playing.

And I really want to play with my cousin and give her gift and friend her but me and her can’t because the game does not allow us to play because we are in different types of mobile and I think it is not fair that we can’t play together and I can only play with people who are in APPLE and she can on

US	2	2021-03-20	6.0.0	sour.lonet	decent	it’s fun but it takes forever to make any serious progress without paying them
US	3	2021-03-20	6.0.0	harleyfreekmode1	I hate training	This is a very fun game, but when you try to train a dragon and get their skill up, they either don’t fire when you hit the screen, or the game says they missed targets, even when they didn’t, and doesn’t give you any credit for it.
US	3	2021-03-20	6.0.0	Tf515	Fun but cash hungry	It’s a fun game but every little thing asks for gems, vip tickets, or money. I wish they would just make it more accessible for free because then it would really be a great game.
US	5	2021-03-19	6.0.0	HersonGpro	Why you should interact with Dragon Mania!	I love playing this game I’ve been playing it for years I always abuse my free time playing this game.I enjoy seeing new dragons designs.it’s a little rough in the beginning but you will get the hand of the game.

US	3	2021-03-10	6.0.0	myloveelli	Too expensive	Your gems are WAY too expensive, $99.99 for 3,800? Who wants to spend $99.99 on a game?! Lower your prices and maybe I’ll consider buying gems, I’m 12 so I’d ya my iTunes gift card but I’ll never EVER spend $99.99 on a game, EVER. Other than that the game is AWESOME, just fix your prices✌🏻
US	3	2021-03-09	6.0.0	Greefer01010101	Ok but does not seem to be a fun game.	When I first got this game I seemed fun but when I started playing it more it got boring very fast.
US	2	2021-03-09	6.0.0	Kyla4853	Starting to get a bad taste	"This used to be a 5 star review, but I’m getting sick and tired of the 2 minute long ads that you can’t get out of. I legit have had to wait over 2 minutes for an “X” button to appear

I also keep getting ads where it’s IMPOSSIBLE to exit out of, so I wind up accidentally going to the play store 4 times before it will go away on its own. It’s very annoying, no one wants to play a game where you get STUCK in an ad. Make the “x” buttons bigger. 

ALSO THERES ADS THAT ARE NOT FOR CHILDREN! This is a CHILDS game, I keep getting an ad, about messaging a MAN!  That is INAPPROPRIATE! DO NOT TEACH CHILDREN THIS! IF THIS IS A CHILDRENS GAME DO NOT HAVE ADS WHERE TALKING TO ABSOLUTE STRANGERS ARE OKAY! That’s wrong! I would never suggest this game, BECAUSE of the ads. Everything else is amazing, but you guys seriously need to take control of your ads and ESPECIALLY get rid of the one that shows children to message random grown men🤬very upset with this game because of that."

US	5	2021-03-08	6.0.0	Nauticol	It’s a fun game to pass the time	It’s a fun simple time passer and hand feeding the cute dragons is a def plus. I think if you like farming games and games that you can raise animals etc this is a good game to fit that need. It goes slow and follows the standard mobile setup you already know how it is but you don’t have to spend money just take your time and be patient.

I was able to sync the game to my phone from my old iPad, however later when I tried to sync my phone with my new iPad it didn’t provide that option even though I had been able to before and had deleted the app from the older iPad that could no longer support the game. I’m not sure why, I believe my account was and is connected to Facebook, however the app doesn’t even provide an option to sync the game’s data with any other account. 
Thank you for your time!"
US	3	2021-03-07	6.0.0	Moonshadow12	It looks promising but...	The game had this weird glitch or error at the beginning which won’t allow me to move on in the game at all. I am stuck at the part where you get your wind dragon and while you feed it you run out of food, well that’s it, it’s just stuck in that point whenever I enter the game it happens. I have tried to contact Gameloft about it but it’s taking a while to get an answer back. Is there anything I can try to move on past this point?
US	5	2021-03-06	6.0.0	njdjdjhx	It’s so amazing!	Hola
US	1	2021-03-06	6.0.0	Insipidnickname	Egregious micro-transactions...	From 5 stars to 1... I can’t handle your micro-transactions any longer... bought your leaf pass to the new event, beat EVERY challenge, EVERY time getting the extra 600 leaf stones and I still only have 185k?!  I lost so much sleep doing this stupid challenge, how can you create events that cost money, people pay them, grind them into affecting their REAL life and STILL NOT give them the stuff they paid for.  Incredibly unbalanced passes, including your typical season passes, which also had me losing sleep to reach the end.  You got $15 from me in the last month.  Shame on me.  Moving on, with my money to games that KNOW how to balance their passes, instead of just robbing their once happy customers.
US	1	2021-03-06	6.0.0	Mcjsr4	Wish it was like Disney Magic Kingdoms	This game is advertised constantly on DMK and I went to check it out. It looked really fun but it is a REALLY busy looking game and a bit complicated. The start up needs to be slower and a bit more steps to walk you through the game.  It also has ADVERTISEMENTS constantly while playing. They pop up while you are looking at the land.  It is crazy and very annoying.  I am happy to watch advertisements but it is nice to have rewards for it or other options.  These just interrupt the game at weird intervals and you are forced to watch them.. which makes you forget what you are looking at.  Ugh!  So frustrating! Learn from DMK and walk through the game.

US	4	2021-03-05	6.0.0	sheishisvsusvuszv	Forced adds🤮	This game is AWESOME it is very fun and VERY well built the graphics are awesome as well my only complaint tho is that there are forced adds
US	4	2021-03-05	6.0.0	Balloon Cake	Good and Bad	"I’ve had this game for a few years now, and it’s actually pretty fun. I love that the creators release new dragons, items, and events very often. It’s fun to visit other people’s dragon lands to see what you can improve on and what you like. I also love the idea of battling other players, not just the battles in which you are going up the path.
So, what don’t I like? Well, for starters, some things are WAY too expensive. I understand that some dragons and structures can be very powerful and can do a lot, but some things cost lots and lots of gems/diamonds. Not everyone can spend that much money on an app. 
The second thing I don’t really like is how many events they have going on at one time. Like, if you don’t play for one week, there are already like 15 new events, tasks, and features. You obviously can not join every single event, and they usually only last for 3-7 days. And some events need you to have so many items before you can continue, and there’s just stuff all over the place, there are so many different events and icons around your screen that it just looks crazy.
Besides that, I don’t have any other issues with the game, but I do hope the few things I do have a problem with get fixed, thank you for reading this crazy long review. Have a wonderful day. :-)"

When I downloaded it on another device (meaning I had to start over, which I didn’t mind) it would already have max habitats at the beginning, making it impossible for me to get anywhere in the game. I don’t know if anyone else has this problem but if it could be fixed somehow, I would definitely download it again!!

My iPad broke and I payed money for stuff (real money) and my iPads screen broke a lot so I can’t play on it anymore but I’m going to order a screen so I can fix it and get my dragons back.

It has dungeons some Mythology in there breeding, battles, and even hatching time. But even with all of those things it has, it still doesn’t deserve 5 stars. It is a pay to win game. You have to wait FOREVER for a decent dragon to hatch. U think I have nothing better to do?. All I’m saying is maybe make each hatching time just an hour or 30 minutes. Do that and maybe I’ll change my review. And by everything I said, plz don’t take affence. Have a great day

Note: This game is a great game but there is a small problem. I don’t like how when you do quests it makes you have to send things to friends. I don’t want to have to send things to people I don’t know to get gems. I still recommend the app but just keel this in mind when playing."

US	2	2021-02-14	6.0.0	rory england is back	A food suggestion	I had an idea while playing the game. I thought why not have different foods for different dragons. For example meat looking types can eat meat and plant looking types eat fruit. Only because every dragon movie they eat meat not fruit but overall I love your game it has a great concept. I think you’re a genius for creating this master peace.

The only thing is that when I tried to switch my account to another device, it made me restart and I had some really really good progress. Also for each dragon you get one of 6 or 7 basic dragon structures but the design of the skin and the color in what differentiates.

US	5	2021-02-10	6.0.0	WolfieTheAlphaOfGacha	game of patience-AND AUDIO BEING STOLEN FROM YOU	"this is an overall great game and i would recommend it to anyone asking!

but this is a game where you have moderate to extremely long wait times so it takes away from the game. I PERSONALLY don’t mind waiting 17 hours to hatch a rare dragon because i know that it’s worth the wait. the only thing is others might not be okay with it. it also takes away from the game if you are spending more time waiting than playing so it’s always a good thing to visit the dungeon for extra gems while you wait. 

A good point of the game is the different dragons you can collect! when i was a young trainer i used to scroll through the dragons and play their animations. 

something that takes away from the game, something others have reported and stressed about is the ads. I don’t mind an ad here and there, especially if it sponsors a game i like and/or getting rewards from it, it’s just that the ads come way too often for a game that keeps itself up well (i would say) you have people buying gems to support your game already so an ad every three seconds is a little overboard. (20 sec ad for fifteen minutes of gameplay is a more fair trade)

ALSO I GOT AN AD FOR A GAME CALLED DRAGON TAMER GENESIS AND THEY STOLE AUDIO FROM THE BATTLE MUSIC IN YOUR GAME IM NOT SURE IF ITS COPYRIGHTED BUT I WANT TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW!

that’s all, thanks for reading my review."

US	1	2021-02-08	6.0.0	Mrs. Skrrt	ADDS!!	Everytime i play after like 20 seconds I get adds pop up. I’ve gotten an add blocker and it still pops up. And no it’s not for the free rolls. The game is good the adds is just too annoying. I tried re installing it and nothing worked.
US	2	2021-02-08	6.0.0	Littleleisl	Customer care as they call themselves is deplorable, Despicable and down right rude.	"I have a love hate with this game. My game has had issues since I started playing, I write tickets they do nothing. They have taken game currency from me, can’t watch videos, don’t get credit or creatures for events. I have to pay thousands of dollars on each event while everyone else is getting what I do not. They will imply that you are a liar. They want exact time and date of issues and screen shots of unforeseen glitches and don’t accept the time and date you take the screenshot and submit ticket, they also false advertise. The game intentionally does not have date and time on screen, which they always want. I tell them look at the date and time it was sent that is when it happened. Now they tell me I need to screen shot my purchases. They are always infallible.
I can not express how much this game has cost me my PTSD, emotional distress, strain on my marriage, anxiety, near nervous breakdown, money thousands or real dollars, they won’t compensate, I still can’t empty Ottos lotto basket.  Participate in events nothing but my grandchildren love it so we share in the petting of the dragons &amp; feeding them if I can afford to feed them 76 million coin buy it just goes on and on the issues in my game are getting increasingly worse and customer care do nothing.
I won a dragon for competing in the Arena now they say that you must have 3 dragons at level 80 to go to elite league which is the one above the league I won. l won the league 1 Arena and it clearly states it is the grand prize for winning at my level. They will not issue I explain it is false advertising and illegal, they will not budge. I’d take them to court but I’m just a little person love to rally a class action lawsuit. I still want to play the game just I want it to be for me the same as for everyone else, a truly fair game.  If I have to write another ticket it will be too soon. Oh yes they ask for screenshots but refuse your email with attachments, then you get an email saying they haven’t heard from you in a while so things must be good this is off me writing and attaching 4-5 times a day, literally. Then they tell you this is a conversation # ID it must be included in all your emails. I do painstakingly only to receive an email stating they closed that case because I wrote to someone else when they were handling it and I put that ID# in the about line and at top of new email everyone. So now I have to start all over again. It would be such an amazingly fun game if it were fair and honest. I love the game but at some point something has to give. I haven’t even scratched the surface here in this review."

When I switched to iPhone I accepted I would have to restart, but that’s okay because it was a good game. But I noticed ads randomly popping up as I play, which it used to never do on Android. It happened too often for the game to be enjoyable, and I sadly will have to find a new favorite.

1. Can you make it so we can kind of screen record in the game it could be a cool feature!

2. Let everyone get about 2 gems a day because for some people they don’t have much gems and don’t wish to spend real money to get them. 

3. Please make the price for some islands lower. I have seen many complaints that they cost to much.

US	1	2021-02-02	6.0.0	avs_sav	Very very disappointed with the new update	"The new update is really aweful ! Super unsatisfied.

I’m left-handed and using stylus, but now all access to the most Often used places (arena, company, clan, dungeon..) locates at the lower left corner.. the MOST possibly uncomfortable (like a blind spot) place for me.. It’s like I need to crutch and twist my hand all the time to play. 
It may only work for those who play the game on the phone with both hands.

Im using iPad and I’m not holding it at my hands . 
Can you imagine  somebody playing the game siting at the table where the device being placed on the special holder stand , and trying to get to the low left corner?!

It would be really helpful if you can make an option to customize the location of the icons (at least to move them up , and switch left-right)..
Or at least move it higher to the middle.. and Return the Clan Icon where it was before.. 
thanks!"
US	3	2021-02-02	6.0.0	Quilter560	Good, but pricey	My grandson loves this game and we play it together.  It’s fun and colorful.  It can be very expensive to buy dragons and things.  Hard to explain to a 5 year old.  It’s a shame everything has a price.
US	1	2021-02-02	6.0.0	potatoofpower	This game was ok but now	Ok so I was ok in the game, had some level 25 dragons, so not that bad. I got a new iPad, and BOOM everything gone!

US	5	2021-01-31	5.9.0	cady wick	😋 good app but...	So I think the game is really good. I played it for 3 years already. I got lots of dragons, but I everything is for diamonds. It’s really annoying because I don’t got a lot. I got lots of coins 🪙 but but the improvements in the game don’t need changing or any improvements to be added. I just can’t handle all th diamonds plus plz do a update to do a dragon called “ house dragon “ witch is a one who you tap and it tikles it’s belly and it has a house hat and a door on the belly. Make it white plz. I want the dragon orange with orange roof with a white window plz I been wanting more dragons for the game. But the herotic campaign map is just for only like level 50s or 60s I am level 48 or 9 I don’t know. My top dragon is only lvl. 30 fire dragon and my user is dragon master but also it doesn’t let m change my name instead dragon master. Plz help I need my name to be “ candy-•-•sweet_! “ plz. So I only give a four rate stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️:) I’d say like it’s good fun never stops in this app. I love ♥️ it much 😘😗🤗 plz replie to this dragon ml if you can cause I don’t know why also... I don’t know why on what is the dragons. Some in the collections button “ dragon codex “ some say limited-time dragon and don’t show what they look like example: it only shows 3 anicent dragons unlocked in the anicent collection and all others are limited-time dragon also for the house dragon plz add dark orange claws and a little black porch with whit ralings on it and the element is “ epic “ and the elements are: shadow ( creeping shadows ) fire ( explosive results or whatever ) and light 💡 ( idk what it does ) and the wings should be little orange wings but dark orange inside and white and black claw next to each other on top of the wing. Thanks for reading my replie but one more thing! Plz add a element called love 💕 it should do love attacks on other dragons and it throws hearts ♥️ into them. And it’s white outline with pink and a white heart in the middle thanks for reading! Replie only if your the owner of the app. Plz!

I think this is unfair it said something about my age? I mean I understand but all my progress was lost literally I spent more than a year playing that game for it just to go to the drain just like that I really want to get my account back.

US	5	2021-01-22	5.9.0	ItsMermaidDeanna	Amazing! But two things..	You have a lot of really good things on this game! And this is higher than those trash games too. The two things you need are less ads and also tell me how to get dragons with the dragons being hidden around me. There are a lot of ads here and too many can make the game not so well. So remove some please. And please tell me how to get the camera.
US	4	2021-01-20	5.9.0	kaitlyn_cohen1🌸	Pretty nice game	Overall it has a lot of fun things to do when it comes to the story line, breeding and hatching dragons, and events/ clan events but it does have its problems. Those would be waiting for portal and arena energy to run out, waiting for food, hatching, and breeding times and what not, especially trying to get those items without running out so easily. But I also noticed you have a skip where you can watch ads to skip 30 minutes and you can watch it quite a few times which is nice. However sometimes, and rather frequent with me, I watch those ads just to skip some time then you don’t even get the 30 minutes off. It’s happened to many times to the point I can’t even remember how many times it’s happened and its rather annoying. Otherwise there isn’t much to complain about this game besides how short and hard certain events are, like the dragon board where some of my lucky stones randomly disappeared without me loosing them and how it was a pain to get one “double trouble” and what not, so I’ll call it a good game for the most part.
US	3	2021-01-20	5.9.0	IrinaBobin	Advertising fraud!	why don't you get a reward when you watch ads?  When you want to shorten the time for hatching eggs, you watch the advertisement 2 or 3 times, and the time is reduced by only 30 minutes, as in one viewing.  the same when you watch an advertisement for a crystal, but you don't get a crystal!
US	5	2021-01-19	5.9.0	jehebejsj	Fun game!but one problem	The game is okay it’s just that the food runs out so quick I want at least 100M food before starting no problem and maybe the gold is spending quickly

I am not a developer of this game but I will still try to address some of these. This game does NOT require you to spend money, it just makes it easier if you want to do it. This game is not a copy of another game, from what I have seen this is a popular game genre, and, dragons. What more do I need to say? I have hardly ever experienced crashes in DragonML, this issue can be fixed with better WiFi connection, or a faster device. This is my favorite game and has been for a long time. I am very excited to see what it will become in the future.

US	4	2021-01-18	5.9.0	V!C+Or	Great game,too expensive	This is a great game! My brother used to have all of the dragon games now he’s older and just plays dragon city which is cool too but dragon mania legends is sooo expensive the hatchery it takes 150 gems like what and also it gets veryyy difficult but all the other parts is great😎
US	5	2021-01-17	5.9.0	Doom's fan	Best game!	I love this game so much! So recommend! The event are fun, you can collect so many dragons! But some stuff cost $. But still love it!

US	4	2021-01-16	5.9.0	Elkfeathers	Pretty good	"I personally love this game. The graphics are wonderful, the music is ethereal, and it’s pretty easy to collect recourses over all, but I have a few complaints.
1, it’s very hard to do anything by playing it free. I only play free games and this game is just really hard without paying actual money. 
2, the wait times are forever and to speed things up it required WAY more gems than anyone playing the game for free can afford.
Otherwise, this is in my top 10 favorite mobile games! Definitely go check it out if you want an alternative to classic zoo-like games like Dragon City or Monster Legends. 8.5/10 from me!"
US	4	2021-01-16	5.9.0	E L L I E & H A R L O W	you can’t delete a dragon once it’s in its habitat	I reached my maximum amount of habitats with only fire and wind now I can’t get any dragons that are other elements please change this.
US	2	2021-01-15	5.9.0	marshmellowdogg	I lost everything...	Me and my cousin used to play this 24/7 way back in like 2015 or sum and I had a ton of stuff and guess what every time I got a new phone it resets all of my progress nothing is there I am very annoyed and disappointed this was really really upsetting for me.
US	5	2021-01-15	5.8.0	🌚it,s me 123	Great game	I love the game it's so fun
US	5	2021-01-14	5.9.0	BlutigeEngel55	Make the “info” and “training” buttons smaller	Make the “info” and “training” buttons smaller  pleeeeease, it’s hard to see my dragons with them being too big ☹️ the character limit for naming dragons is too small. Only six characters is too little and I think at least 10 characters would be more fitting.
US	1	2021-01-14	5.9.0	Hello your awsome !	i am so mad at this stupid game	ok so i got this game like five years ago and i was super far in it i had like level 30 pr 40 dragons and in the map i was level 100!! and the i got a new ipad and befor i got the ipad when it was coming i saved my icloud stirage and when i got my new ipad i lost all of my fresking progres and the game is like oh let me show you how to frickin feed my dragon’s and i had one divine dragon and fifteen legendary dragon’s so ya.
US	1	2021-01-14	5.9.0	Ryland1330	Way too many ads	The game has so many random ads that pop up all the time. I am ok with ads for “free” perks, but all the random ads are obnoxious.
US	5	2021-01-13	5.9.0	Bh32	This is the best game ever	This game is so fun I love getting new dragons it’s the best feeling ever
US	1	2021-01-13	5.9.0	T121420	Freezing	This was a fun game my kids and I play. However when you get to complete a dragon ruin it will constantly freeze. It won’t let you forge or exit. You have to do a hard quit of the app. If this was fixed I would give it 5 stars.
US	2	2021-01-12	5.9.0	Mast3rY!n	Used to love this game	I have been an active player of this game for 4 years. I love all of the updates and all of the new content since I started. Sadly I don’t think I will be playing anymore. I got a new phone and tried transferring my data and it isn’t possible to do between android and iOS. I tried contacting support but after over a week with no reply I am not hopeful I will ever get that data back.
US	4	2021-01-12	5.9.0	icoukdnt	Great game for the majority	Great game, BUT SO MANY FRICKIN ADS. I WATCH ONE AD SND IT BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER AND SOMETIMES AN AD VIDEO JUST POPS OUT FOR NO REASON.

US	5	2021-01-11	5.9.0	Niareline	ITS LITERALLY THE BEST GAME I HAVE PLAYED. I play every single day😆	It’s so cool
US	4	2021-01-11	5.9.0	Converter44	Amazing game. There is just a few bugs	I love this game a lot and it’s very addicting. The only thing is that there is a bug in the store and they haven’t fixed it yet. I’ve had this game forever and the bug has been there since I’ve gotten it almost. I spent all of my gems to upgrade the hatchery and then I tried to buy gem island and I couldn’t. Now I am stuck with 2 gems. FIX THIS PLEASE IT IS SO ANNOYING! Another thing is that I think gems should be easier to get. It is so hard to get gems without buying them and there are more things to get with gems in the store than actual coins. At least make it so when you open chests in the portal you get, like, 10 gems instead of 1. One more thing is that I think they should add an egg storage like, when they are done breeding you could add the egg to storage if you don’t have room in your hatchery. The game is already awesome but it would be so much better with just a few changes.
US	5	2021-01-10	5.9.0	Susan Amy	?	Why does it need ID card number?😭
US	5	2021-01-10	5.9.0	Insipidnickname	Son loves it	Has a great simple and clean art style, with easy, zen-like combat.  Wish the main screen was less cluttered with “buy this and upgrade that”.  Some of the free-to-play mechanics are fairly intrusive but keeps you busy long enough before putting it down typically.  CROSS-PLAY would greatly be appreciated!!  I’ve now downloaded for my son on his fireHD Tablet so he won’t need my phone but can’t play with him from my iPhone.  Super disappointing.  Other than that, great job!  Super impressed!
US	4	2021-01-09	5.9.0	Slday427	Fun for a time	Great game, super addicting. However, once you reach a certain point, game crashes. I’m at level 48 and now I can’t play the game more than 15sec and it crashes. Doesn’t matter how much WiFi I have, game won’t stay loaded for long. Really disappointing, considering how much time I put into the game. Very fun otherwise!
US	5	2021-01-09	5.9.0	Blue Nird	I love this!	When I was a kid I played this a lot, I found the game again and I’m so happy to play this! I’ve been playing and it’s awesome with all the adventures, And I’ve seen no bugs! 5 out of 5 for me.

US	1	2021-01-09	5.9.0	the proffesionl describer	ITS A COPY!!!!!	This game is a LEGIT COPY of DRAGON CITY you breed them the same Like UGH don’t just copy games everythin* is a copy
US	4	2021-01-08	5.9.0	WJOHeu	Nice game.	"PROS
- Beautiful graphics! Each dragon has a unique charm and smooth, cute animations. 
- Cute features! For example, you can pet your dragons and get extra gold. Adorable!
- Easy features like “Multi-plant”
- Developers are considerate.
- You’ll never be bored of the same dragons

CONS
- The league battles are difficult and unfair. You have to spend thousands of gold trying to find an appropriate, evenly-matched opponent. People who are WAY higher than you will pick on you and easily drag your league rank down.
Within MOMENTS of winning a game and getting +15 trophies, someone will beat you and you’ll lose -18 trophies. If you want to revive a dragon for just a chance of winning, you have to spend 25 gems- a lot of expensive currency.
- Again- it is incredibly difficult to find a matching opponent."

US	2	2021-01-07	5.9.0	brandys1107	Annoyed and can’t get help	I was loving this game so I asked my husband to download it and join using my referral code. My redraw code says invalid when he enters it. So I tried using his instead and it says the same thing. I should be able to have him enter my code and get the rewards for it but it’s not working. There is no way to communicate with a person about this!! So frustrated!
US	5	2021-01-07	5.9.0	TayTotTime26	I’m almost dead	"I love this game. Collecting dragons and making a great island are just a few of the reasons. It's way better than dragon city. I've tried so many times to play that game, but it just isn't very fun like this game. I've been playing for about 3 years now, and it provides challenges and some easy stuff. It's not pay-to-win like some of the reviews say. The ads aren't that bad either. Give it a try!

alright so I was just sitting with my headphones on and a notification comes and I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK my sister was making fun of me because apparently it looked like I was getting electrocuted"

US	5	2021-01-06	5.9.0	zomesudn	I love this game, but a few suggestions	This game is worth it! I have so much fun in battles and upgrading my dragons, however, I feel as though that there should be more opportunities to get gems for free, because not a lot of people necessarily wants to pay for gems
US	5	2021-01-06	5.9.0	abcd7979	Best game	I just got this game  🕹 and I think it is so  amazing 👍💯and the dragons are so cute 🤩
US	4	2021-01-05	5.9.0	Anonymous_me_anonymouse	READ PLZ	So, this game is truly amazing! I feel like the the creator spent a really long time to make this game perfect, and he/she did! But, it pretty expensive to remove large trees to get more land. I kinda wish the prices were lower for the trees and some other stuff. Other than that, this game is spectacular, 100% recommend.

US	4	2021-01-04	5.9.0	EKangaroo	I loooove this game	I can’t stop playing it but I hate it when you have to wait sooo long for 1 egg to hatch or a habitat to be finished being built. Also I think it’s wrong that you make so few diamonds or money so expensive. But other than that your game is amazing
US	4	2021-01-03	5.9.0	jkpisjsjshgfggdduhdjdiixhss	l can't get more habitats anymore	so this game is great 👍🏽 and all but l had no more space and l just had a legendary dragon 🐉 pop up and l had just enough gems 💎 to buy it so you should really have a 100/100 habitats thing because the normal habitats only have 18/18 so bye

US	5	2021-01-03	5.9.0	rvseattle	Love this game	I've been playing this game for six years now, and love it even more than I did when I started. You have to understand that you're in it for the long game – and that means that any particular battle or quest is just a means to an end. The fun is in the endlessly changing strategy and variety that are offered.

US	4	2020-12-30	5.9.0	Insipidnickname	Son loves it	Has a great simple and clean art style, with easy but zen-like combat.  Wish the main screen was less cluttered with “buy this and upgrade that”.  Some of the free-to-play mechanics are fairly intrusive but keeps you busy long enough before putting it down typically.  Had some annoying situations where I purchased my son the “Mr. Popsicle” Boss dragon he wanted early on and had no where to put it, all while it blocked the egg incubator with no in-game hints to point out what I was to do.  Had to purchase a habitat (with gems) which is not known to new players nor is it known that you can’t actually use him... super annoying and was a progress halting game-design error that almost had me delete it... would be nice to find some fixes for that.
US	1	2020-12-29	5.9.0	JagaurGirl	UGH	The only reason I got this was because dragonvale was not working. And this was a let down. Everything costs money, it takes so ling to level up, there are very few dragons, and its just boring.
US	4	2020-12-29	5.9.0	roblox lover 54	Good but.....	Ok love this game, but I have to be honest! I got this game because I thought I could scan and get dragons for free, but no, that’s not how it works! You have to buy them with coins! This is like the add for dragon city! In dragon city you can’t scan either! Of course this game has some good things about it! If you log in for a certain amount of days, you may get a free dragon from the check-in’s! Thanks a ton for reading my review! Stay safe!

US	4	2020-12-29	5.9.0	ffdsvv	DRAGONS	So I like the dragons but sometimes it’s unfair because I breed the same ones and that one makes me a little angry. It also has the quests and I feel like sometimes they’re unfair. But otherwise I like the game.

US	3	2020-12-28	5.9.0	xaulr	Please read	I used to play this game on an android kindle, loved it. I even logged into facebook and got 10 free gems. Whenever I deleted the app and redownloaded it, I could just log in back with my facebook account and my island and everything else would be saved. I bought an iPad, and when I tried to log in with my facebook account, it wouldn’t load my island. It would just show the starter island with 10 free gems and a dragon. But when I log in on anything android, my island is there.. Why’s that? Is it a bug or a glitch? Please fix this.
US	5	2020-12-28	5.9.0	Erwinsgirl	Best game I ever played	This game was my type of game! It has dragons and that’s the games I like! My favorite dragons are the red wins but I like all of them!

US	3	2020-12-26	5.9.0	ummhhh	Mickelle	Hate the new dungeon. Wish it was quite so expensive to feed dragons. And to be really competitive it’s really expensive. The rest of the game is fun. I have an erratic work schedule so sometimes I do really well at timed events and sometimes I almost miss the whole thing. I love the new legendary dragons. We need a strong legendary with the wind element.

US	5	2020-12-22	5.9.0	lilreggae	Pretty good game but one major issue for me	I like the game but I have one issue that makes me mad and that’s the fact that when I defeat the portal bosses I have to pay a so many gems for something I defeated. Like I feel that, when you defeat that boss for that level you should get the boss as a free reward rather than a buy reward.

US	3	2020-12-19	5.9.0	wolfplays69	Habitat limits and selling dragons	I got the game and thought it would be fun... and it was! But a few years later I got it on my iPad and I loved it! Until a few months later I got a new dragon that I wanted to keep I went into the store to buy a habitat and it said that habitat limit was reached. I was hoping that I could sell some of my dragons that I didn’t like but it didn’t let me. I got really angry and deleted the game. I was hoping like other games the data would be lost but no it wasn’t. I think you shouldn’t have habitat limits. It would make the game more enjoyable. It’s one of my favorite games. I would really like to play it again.
US	5	2020-12-19	5.9.0	The fall days	I love this game!	This game is so good! You can do so much things! I love how you can do battles and make your team stronger. I also love boss fights! You can get so many varieties of so many dragons! I love this game so much!
US	5	2020-12-19	5.9.0	Afrixangreylover	Great game!	Great game but I have ine problem with it,and that’s that it calls some words abusive when they’re not abusive. I tried to name one of my dragons Spotty,and it said the name I selected contained abusive words. It was the same case with Spot. How are those words abusive?! Also one more thing. Please make an update that you can make your dragon names as long as you want. 6 letters is too little. I am a wings of fire fan and I’ve named some of my dragons after wof characters but there are some names I’d like to use but can’t such as Starflight and Kinkajou,and Anemone.(Those names are too long)
US	5	2020-12-19	5.9.0	RyneAndal	Apple players	"So for some reason apple players are not able to change their username and I don’t really like how Samsung and PC players have the option to change their name, I think it’s unfair that us apple players can’t change our names and we are just stuck as; DragonMaster etc. I would absolutely appreciate it if us apple players could have a username. On my Samsung account I am able to change my username if I want to but on Apple I don’t have a choice. Otherwise this game is totally awesome and I recommend you get it, plus it’s free and the in game purchases are extremely cheap, and there is always a sale. Please keep making this game better and better I really enjoy playing 😊

                 Sincerely, A ten year old who is obsessed :3"
US	5	2020-12-19	5.9.0	WaterNiada	I love it! But the gems.	I love this a LOT but the problem is the gems you need every two secs. Ex: so say you have this dragon you want, but you look at the price and it says 2,500 gems. How do expect that so fast? But overall this is a REALLY good game.
US	4	2020-12-18	5.9.0	HomeschoolMomfl	One major flaw	I love the game but the free videos to earn various objects only works 25% of the time and doesn’t matter if using WiFi or cellular which forces you to buy gems eggs fruit etc in order to advance within the game.  If this were fixed it would earn a 5 stars because of the interaction with the dragons and multiple play actions within the game.
US	5	2020-12-17	5.9.0	Blossom the dragon	This game is AMAZING I wish there was a gift every second! With 100,00(00,00 jems coins and food	Tell the creators I love them!
US	5	2020-12-16	5.9.0	Juliemk111	This game is pretty good	I really like this game, and I think that whoever the creators of this game are did a really good job. I am not very good at writing reviews, so... bye?
US	5	2020-12-16	5.9.0	Amir Hill	Good Game, but some bugs..	It’s an amazing game no doubt, but a few bugs sometimes.
US	5	2020-12-15	5.9.0	WJOHeu	Great!	"- Beautiful graphics! Each dragon has a unique charm and smooth, cute animations.

- Developers are considerate.
- You’ll never be bored of the same dragons"
US	1	2020-12-15	5.9.0	Littleleisl	Customer care as they call themselves is deplorable, Despicable and down right rude.	"I have a love hate with this game. My game has had issues since I started playing, I write tickets they do nothing. They have taken game currency from me, can’t watch videos, don’t get credit or creatures for events so I have to pay thousands of dollars on each event while everyone else is getting what I do not. They will imply that you are a liar. The game intentionally does not have date and time on screen, which they always want. I tell them look at the date and time it was sent that is when it happened. Now they tell I need to screen shot my purchases. They are always infallible.
I can not express how much this game has cost me my PTSD, emotional distress, strain on my marriage, anxiety, near nervous breakdown, money thousands or real dollars, they won’t compensate, I still can’t empty Ottos lotto basket.  Participate in events nothing but my grandchildren love it so we share in in petting the dragons feeding them if I can afford to feed them 76 million coin buy it just goes on and on the issues in my game are getting increasingly worse and customer care do nothing.
I won a dragon for competing in the Arena now they say that you must have 3 dragons at level 80 to get to elite league which is the one above the league I won. l won the league 1 Arena and it clearly states it is the grand prize for winning at my level. They will not issue I explain it is false advertising and illegal, they will not budge. I’d take them to court but I’m just a little person love to rally a class action lawsuit. I still want to play the game just I want it to be for me the same as everyone else. If I have to write another ticket it will be too soon. Oh yes they ask for screenshots but refuse your email with attachments, then you get an email saying haven’t heard from you in a while so things must be good this is off me writing and attaching 4-5 times a day, literally. Then they tell you this is a conversation # ID it must be included in all your emails, I do painstakingly only to receive an email stating the closed that case because I wrote to someone else when they were handling it and I put that ID# in the about line and at top of new email everyone. So now I have to start all over again. It would be such an amazingly fun game if it were fair and honest. I love the game but at some point something has to give. I haven’t even scratched the surface here in this review."
US	5	2020-12-14	5.9.0	buttcrapes	Best Game Ever	I just downloaded this wonderful game thinking it would not be too great, but it was amazing! It is worth downloading it into your phone or iPad. I think you should download it and see what you think!
US	1	2020-12-14	5.9.0	kfkddkjdsj	I like it but...	I love this game but there is a ad that you have to get out of the app to get rid of it it’s there’s never an x button they need to just remove that ad!!! REMOVE THE AD!!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
US	5	2020-12-14	5.9.0	damon of paris	Great Game but .............	"Dragon mania legends also known as DML
Is a game which mainly consists of breeding, harvesting, conquering, and battling. 

Battling can be segmented into arena, sigil campaign, clan, enchantment league, main battling campaign and other types of event battling. 

The only things you can harvest is food and coins and in terms of conquering its mostly about buying lands and clearing objects on lands.

 Breeding is when two dragons with different elements pass their elements into one dragon and the number of elements may vary from dragon to dragon. Besides from breeding you can get dragons from participating in events, dungeons or by collecting daily rewards or joining Facebook.

DML is a great game which contains unbelievable features, beautiful quality and dragons of all shapes and sizes, cute and scary. However  i find that finding friends is hard because I don’t want to add friends nearby. So please add a feature which will allow players to connect and add friends without having to use your code or connect by using Facebook."

US	5	2020-12-13	5.9.0	Female who likes math	Omg it’s sook fun	Omg play this game it’s a little laggy but play it like it has all the dragons you need in your life
US	5	2020-12-12	5.9.0	noseybooku	Great Gamin!	"This is a great game because you can like. Dragons!!!! There are so many mysterious dragons to collect. And if you save up enough gems you might just be able to upgrade you Hatchery! If you are at level 20. You get Sigils. Which is a great thing to have when battling other people or NPCs. 
I can play this game forever! You get badges! And trophies! You will love it!
You can buy other islands and upgrade habitats! If you feed you dragons to level 16 or higher you can enchant them! You can build farms and save up money! Hope you really like this byyyyye!"
US	5	2020-12-12	5.9.0	Avery02244	I love this game!	I love this game! I once had Dragon City, and it was junk compared to this!!!
US	4	2020-12-12	5.9.0	Jam.19	Pretty good	I like the game, but every time I play it starts showing a merge magic ad. ITS REALLY ANNOYING!!!!! I haven’t been able to breed a dragon in a month! So please can you stop showing these ads. The good news is, in my opinion, the best game ever. I also have dragon city, but DML is WAY better. Any way, my score keeps changing. I have twenty seven dragons, but it says I have twenty four. But the game is still awesome. That’s all the complaints I have but can you please fix both of them.                                                            P.S it also keeps crashing!

US	4	2020-12-12	5.9.0	eeveekinght	I love this game	I love the game but I think they should make it easier to get more than just 3 spaces for battle energy
US	5	2020-12-11	5.9.0	stay positive reviews	Dragon ml	This is a great game! I always enjoy playing it! But I don’t like that you need to pay for some of the cooler things.
US	4	2020-12-11	5.9.0	Olivia67585	Amazing Game a Little Bit of Flaws Though	"I honestly love this game a lot! I currently have 29 dragon species. The battle mechanism is great it’s simple to use. It’s kind of a pay-to-win game but if you don’t want to pay for VIP there is VIP tickets to be VIP temporarily for a day. I love the design of basically all the dragons. The graphics are good. It’s a chill game not too much going on but not too little. I like how when you don’t have both space left on an island you can just buy a new one. I also love that there’s event dragons if you don’t want the normal dragons, there’s more of a variety.

   Some things I don’t like about the game is that the duration of time you have to wait for stuff annoys me. I feel like some things in the game are TOO easy to get like Legendary habitats. Some things like dragons and upgrading your Hatchery cost too much gems, I think it would be more reasonable for the Hatchery to cost 120 gems instead of 150. I also have one more thing I don’t like and  it’s the fact that some dragons when breeding is too hard to get. Say if you have a tri-element dragon and you breed it with something there’s so many possible dragons that you can get. But overall the game is nice."

US	2	2020-12-10	5.9.0	Kenleigh12	Good game	Good game but some problems, when ever I buy gems I usually get a dragon but it always says that I need to pay more gems. I would like the game more if it just gave me the dragon I bought.
US	4	2020-12-10	5.9.0	sami the Best roblox player	Definitely recommend	I love the game i started playing today in is better then dragon city you heard me. I love thjs and cant wait for the new updates but could you pls just make things cost less gems its unaffordable anyways I recommend this game for quarantine

- You’ll never be bored of the same dragons.

CONS:
- Buggy. For instance, I decided to create a clan, which costs 1M gold (a LOT of money for my level). The game took my 1M gold. However, I never got my clan. Another example- the game fooled me. I was in a league battle against a player whose best dragon was listed as a similar level to mine (level 23); however, their dragon was actually level 28. FAIR league opponents are VERY hard to run into; I have spent literally 1M gold trying to find a fightable opponent (each refresh is 2,500 gold). 
- The enchantment league is plain unfair. People with better dragons will pick on you and you’ll get like 15 trophies taken; however, if you successfully defend you only gain 8. 
- After a certain level, it becomes difficult to make your dragons more powerful (through leveling up by feeding, enchanting with fragments, etc.)

I love the animations and the dragons are so cute!!! I also love that the battles are so interactive! You can also train your dragons in a little mini game! Just one thing, I know this might sound selfish but I hate having to wait for an egg to hatch or for a breeding to end, and sometimes I end up with no gems at all! It doesn’t matter if you change this or not, either way I love ya he game and well done!
US	5	2020-12-10	5.9.0	run itt	Love the game! But it’s too hard!	You should make it we’re you can delete you dragons. And were there’s new dragons

US	5	2020-12-08	5.9.0	Evelyn the Harry Potter fan	Super awesome!	This game is amazing! I love sooo much! The only thing is I wish I didn’t take so long to breed. I’m breeding a dragon right now but it says it is going to take 4 hours. You can watch a video to skip the process but it won’t work. Please can you shorten the breeding and hatching time to maybe 2 to 4 minutes? But the game is still awesome!

US	5	2020-12-02	5.8.0	zeezzbaby	Recommended	This is recommended because this is a great app you should definitely get it. It has no bugs I don’t think but, it’s a awesome app  you should definitely get this app if you were considering getting it.
US	5	2020-12-01	5.8.0	BethyJ123	I think it’s a pleasant game	I think it’s a really nice game! And I accidentally pressed “I don’t like it” when it asked for my feedback so if it says I don’t like it, it was a misclick.
US	2	2020-11-30	5.8.0	myistic lover	I lost everything	So let me tell you, this game is really fun, but it does get kinda boring after along time, and after you get higher levels with higher level dragons it get too hard to beat the battles, and soon I had to switch my phone to the iPhone 12, and when I played the game, it restarted all of my 3 years worth of progress, I lost every dragon (which I had almost all of them) all my progress, i lost everything, I spent 3 years worth of progress which made me really upset, and it took me 3 years to get every dragon I had and every bit of progress I had, and I don’t use Facebook or Game Center, so I can’t get anything back, and I finally just deleted the game, I’m really upset and wouldn’t recommend changing devices when you have a lot of progress on this game, cause you will lose everything if you don’t have Facebook or you don’t use Game Center, I would honestly recommend not to even get the game, cause it gets really hard once you get far in, and I’m really surprised i actually got high in the game without spending any money, so my recommendation is to not even get the game, cause when you switch your device you will probably lose everything.

US	5	2020-11-25	5.8.0	JungleBunny26	Awesome	I love the game so so so much it’s really fun I love how you get to battle other dragons that the Viking has some of the dragons were hard for me to defeat but I was able to defeat them and it was so much fun playing this game although I do kind a wish they were a few changes like when you’re going to place a dragon and you don’t have the habitat for it then once you press place it would take you to the habitat it needs.
US	1	2020-11-25	5.8.0	Flem06	It didn’t work	I had this game and I transferred it into my new IPad and it didn’t transfer and l asked sooooo many times.
US	3	2020-11-24	5.8.0	#Catgurl	Don’t assume things	This is a great game, don’t get me wrong, but I hate your ads choices. When I put in my age ( I’m a teenager) you began showing me all these ads about not to smoke or vape and what the real cost is, I thought, “ Hey, its a one time thing.” Until those were the only ads I was seeing, you can’t just think that I’ll smoke or vape just because of my age, so please fix this, it just seems rude for you to think that I will vape or smoke at my age and I will keep sending this same complaint until I at least get a response!
US	5	2020-11-23	5.8.0	lilXredX	The best game in the world🥳🤗	I love this game soooooooo much and I have tons of reasons why! But I am going to start with two things that I wish should be changed. It’s when it says that I can not add anymore habitats for my baby dragons. And that that could never happen. Second is that I think on Friday, we should make everything a lower price so that it’s more easy to buy dragons and upgrade the breeding cave. Over all, this game is the best game I have on my phone and I have 100 games in total!! I love this game because of all the dragons you can collect and because breeding all of the dragons as you can! All of the dragons and Dino’s are amazing and would take a very creative mind of yours to come up with all of them! And I think that if I go on talking about all of the things I love about this game it would go on forever! So I am just going to add one of my most favorite things about this game. And it is.....................EVERYTHING(except the things that I wanted fixed)!!! I am sorry if all the things is not an answer to you. But it’s still ok if you cannot do all the things that I asked. Thank you for everything!🤗

Maybe it’s just something wrong with my internet, but I don’t think so, as I have two different internets, and both are at Max power. If you could fix that, I would add a 5-Star Review. Please fix this.

Park"
US	4	2020-11-20	5.8.0	good going person	Good game	Okay this game is really good and I hope you download it based off this review. First, I love all the different types of dragons you can get. Some are really cool looking, and others really funny looking. Also, leveling up dragons is super satisfying. Like from 19 to 20, there damage and health go up so much. Okay, those were just things I liked about it, because I don’t really know how to write a review. Also warning, this game takes awhile to get good at, so if can’t deal with waiting, then you may not enjoy this game. So, yeah, download the game and have some fun.

US	3	2020-11-14	5.8.0	JessicaTaij	Great game, one issue	I’ve been playing this game for about a year.  In that amount of time, I have had a switch of devices.  I recently got a new phone, and i would like to transfer my data from my other phone to this one.  A simpler process?
US	5	2020-11-14	5.8.0	yo! yo! yo yo	Awesome!!!!!!	Love this game but it needs one thing. It needs a feature making Islands it would be awesome so when you run out of room for your dragons you can make a new island it would be awesome please do this!

Now on November 14 2020 I got a earth 🌎 and slammander dragon 🐉 (i don’t know how do spell it) and it was so fun 🤩 and amazing 😻! You don’t need to pay the fun 🤩 is already there.

US	4	2020-11-12	5.8.0	6276401passworD	Constantly crashing	Play it off and on for a couple years. Right now it crashes constantly needing a restart.
US	5	2020-11-12	5.8.0	ReviewWritingBo i	Awesome game!	"I’m just gonna start by saying how much I truly enjoy this game. But there are some things that I think could be changed or added. First off,  I find it really annoying when I log onto the game and collect my coins from my dragons, and then at least one has a button to watch an ad for gems. I understand that it’s a free game and the devs need to have ads or else they don’t get money from the game, just maybe a little less adds would be great. And another thing; maybe the devs could make a mechanic where the coins collected from petting dragons stacks. For example, if you don’t play for a few days, and therefore don’t pet your dragons for those few days, the coins they give you should be more than normal. Idk, just a thought.
But overall this is a super great game and I love it!"
US	5	2020-11-12	5.8.0	Tasha922	Got	Thanks so I can do you all for the week I am so happy to see your schedule and you know I am so proud of you all the wonderful things

US	5	2020-11-09	5.8.0	HUFFLEPUFFNooodle420	Very fun but i have an suggestion	This game is super fun and all the dragons are cute but i think that when you beat a “ boss battle “ you should get the dragon or a least have the option to get it but overall this game is great definitely recommend
US	5	2020-11-09	5.8.0	zs😴	A good game	The graphics are great and the dragons are so cool and it’s a really fun but interesting overall it’s a really good game and I hope someday I can make one just as good.
US	3	2020-11-09	5.8.0	Tennisgirl555	Customer care button doesn’t work	I love this game and wanted to start over after having not played it in so long. Sadly I tried to contact customer care in the options menu and all that happens is that it turns gray. I’m so disappointed. I tried googling options and I couldn’t find a way to contact them. I hope other people have more success than me!

US	4	2020-11-08	5.8.0	M-adilyn	A review	I honestly think this is a good game but the problem is that I think it’s just me but I don’t know how to get dragons to move into a different habitat and it’s really hard to play without any space and you want to breed dragons to make other dragons and learn.
US	5	2020-11-07	5.8.0	nqqqqeen	The best game ever	It is alsome I and all my friends play it

US	5	2020-11-06	5.8.0	Foodsmyfavorite	Great Game 🐲	"Please fix the adds there is this 1 add that I have seen like a million times! I used to have a lot of amazing dragons then I forgot about the game and did not play it for a few months but I did not delete it and when I finally remembered about the game and started playing it again I lost one ☝🏻 of my really good dragons 🐉.
PLEASE FIX!!!!"

US	4	2020-11-04	5.8.0	MUN1445441	I want to trade	So I LOVE DML but there is one flaw. The one and only flaw. If ppl haven’t already written a rev. about this, then that’s insane. I want to be able to trade on this game. If I could trade, then I would give it 5 million stars. I don’t just want to trade normal things like enchantment crystals or buildings such as habitats and stuff. I also want to trade dragons! Bc what if someone has a dragon they don’t like and so do I? But I like the one they don’t like, and they like the one I don’t like? We could trade! Like a Dusk dragon for a Kitty dragon or a Venom dragon for a Tree dragon. That type of thing. Please please listen to me. Please. This is the only thing I want out of this game, please. Please.
US	2	2020-11-04	5.8.0	maxie trizzy tracy	Review	The game is nice but the updates are very annoying and the amount of storage this takes is crazy so I’m not a big fan but it’s a fun game
US	4	2020-11-04	5.8.0	Foodsmyfavorite	It’s a good game but...	Dragon Mania Legends is a good game but if you delete it or get a new device it does not save your progress it is very annoying if you had really good dragons please fix this.

US	5	2020-11-04	5.8.0	sickkitty1243	Best game ever	Best game ever but I am only 9 years old
US	3	2020-11-04	5.8.0	GamerGameArtist	Improvements Could Be Made	Would be better without the pop-up ads that appear when you collect gold or try to do anything else on your islands. I get that the app needs to make money to run, but I feel like it should be a little easier to get gems since the wait times are so long and gems are the only way to speed up the process (and cost real life money)
US	5	2020-11-03	5.8.0	zayyking22	My opinion	I love this game so much and it just a game I play when I’m stressed and it makes me happy and all the different adventures it has is so entertaining
US	5	2020-11-03	5.8.0	kittycat_hayden2011	Great but sometimes boring	I like it but it boring sometimes it’s a really good game but second thought it’s like a pay to win thing idk what pay to win means so yea it’s definitely a really great game I bet it took one month to finish all the animations and the graphics I like playing games but I don’t like making them because it take like forever to finish
US	5	2020-11-03	5.8.0	Love for Jauregui ❤️	ehyshs	yes
US	5	2020-11-03	5.8.0	Becky O	Why you should download this game XD	So when I started this game I had so much fun now I have so much dragons so download this game for dragons coins and other cool fun stuff!!
US	3	2020-11-03	5.8.0	Babs9006	Fun, but annoyed	I started playing this game as a way to connect with my nieces and nephews.  I love the beauty and creativity of all the dragons and surprises within the game.  What makes me sad and annoyed is the limitations placed on me through some of the events.  I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on gem stones to grow my dragons, enchant them, and add sigils.  When you only allow dragons with certain elements into events, you negate all that investment and time.
US	5	2020-11-03	5.7.2	sophist42	This game is so satisfying, I play it every day	I love this game
US	5	2020-11-03	5.7.2	The best rating 5 stars!	Another one of my best dragon games	This dragon game is like dragon city! U can feed your dragons but u can throw it or throw it up to them and they can catch and eat it! They have farms, habitats, quest, breeding, and fighting!
US	4	2020-11-02	5.7.2	notezaza8808	Me like	It is pretty good I only like it so far please make more updates so we can have more fun and play it is a very good game thank you for making this game. Sorry if the spelling is dumb
US	5	2020-11-02	5.7.2	GreatGameing12345	Awesome game!	This game is great I love it it always has something fun to do and I love it. It is so awesome that I can describe the game, the people reading this give the game a try and you will like it guarantee.
US	5	2020-11-01	5.7.2	#Sunny_dayz	LOVE this game	"Omg I LOVE this game. It is so much better than dragon city because you can get sooo much more dragons, there is sooo much more free gold, gems etc. It has way more things to do than dragon city. Like once I had 0 everything and 2 minutes later I had 11 gems and 301,000 gold. It is just so much more fun in general and I’m very happy with my choice to get this game.
And I accidentally said I did not like the game because I thought it wanted me to write a  review. But I just want y’all to know that I love your game and I think everyone should have it."
US	2	2020-11-01	5.7.2	buff13738	Meh	It’s not very good it has a lot of weird stuff and the graphics are bad I give it a two star rating and it’s really dumb I think this should shorten the time to wait for a new dragon when you’re breeding
US	5	2020-11-01	5.7.2	giyuvgkgvuktuckctk	The Best it’s going to be I think	DML is a really good game.I used to play it when I was younger , but I wish it had no ads.There are like a small amount of ads almost none but after like  years it still has a little amount of ads.Over all this game is sooooooooooooooooooooooo pawesome and awesome.

And I’m just loving my dragons so much better now than ever before and I’m on level 24! This is the best day ever ever and I’m just so excited for a clan! 🤩🤩💕love love love the game!!!
And from times to times the game is not a easy a for me but I am loving the game and I have been playing this game for about......... a few months of this game is so much fun but it is so much harder than the start and the game is not much good service but I am loving this game thank you for the fun game!
I hope you will let me be not known as dragon master 351681 please please help me and all of the players please please thank you for all the help and I wanted you to know that I am not sure if I am going to make it to level 30 because I was not able to make it to the level 25. I am on level 30 now and I am mad 😡 because you are not going to let me make a clan or nothing 🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
US	1	2020-10-29	5.7.2	Felwickid	Don’t do it!	"Once you start paying real money you will get nothing in return, you contact them, and nothing gets done.
 I am looking into filing a legal action against dragon mania, I had paid real money but neither my gems, chests, milestones of any of the prices have been honored or given in anyway, it keeps logging me off and I had sent numerous requests on costumer service and nothing had been done, I would like to collect signatures to see who will want to join in a legal suit."

US	4	2020-10-28	5.7.2	dakaei	Amazing but	When we get a duplicate dragon we should enchant them to a better dragon and also you should put evolve term to combine multiple dragons
US	4	2020-10-27	5.7.2	snoball 111	It’s great but	I love this game and I have a suggestion so when someone wants to get ride of a dragon and instead how about maybe you can send it as a gift to a friend.

US	5	2020-10-26	5.7.2	angry peroson1245)789	A great app! I really love playing it!!!!	I love this game!!!!  I am play it for hours and hours. The only thing that I would change is how long it takes to breed 2 dragons or how long it takes to hatch an egg. I know sometimes it takes a 30 hour but sometimes it takes 19 hours. But other whose the dragons are cute, I love doing battles and training them, this game is really fun!! But ya I would change how long it takes to do those 2 things. ☺️☺️☺️😊😊😊☺️☺️☺️😊😊😊! Great app guys.

US	5	2020-10-25	5.7.2	KINGCAMARIE	Dragon mania legends	I love this game you could collet over 700 dragons this game is the coolest makes me feel better when in a bad mood I’m so glad that I downloaded.
US	4	2020-10-25	5.7.2	bbdog888	Awesome! But...	"I only have this game for a little while and I’m already love it. It’s really fun, but I have a few pet peeves. First off, the wait time is so long, and you need to pay to skip! Watching ads barely puts a dent in the amount of time you wait for. I get that you need to make money, but if you could shorten the waiting time or make the ads take away an hour, I think you would see a lot more good reviews. Second, I seriously think you should consider adding a trading system. Just allow the players to trade dragons with their friends on the app, and it will add a lot of new ways to get the very hard to earn dragons. I get that there are scammers, but maybe try adding a system where each person needs to approve the trade before it goes through. Also think about adding a feature where it says the rarity of the dragon in the trade, so kids don’t get scammed into thinking they are getting a super rare dragon for their common dragon, when really it might be vice versa. 

Thanks, 
          Milly."

US	1	2020-10-24	5.7.2	Hopper023	Disgusting micro transactions	Charging $5+ for things you can unlock in similar games without real money.  Plus, RANDOM pop up adds.  Other apps give you something for making the choice to watch an add but this one just makes you watch it...  whenever they feel like it. Lol.   Don’t support companies that use business models like this in games.  Disgusting...

US	4	2020-10-19	5.7.1	fabiolajohnson	Some updates that this game really needs	"I understand that the game is perfect the way it is for you guys,but I have some ideas so that your thought will go from perfect to amazed.
1:The ability for trainers to make the dragons they have a certain age.This way,if trainers wanted more baby dragons,they could revert there dragon’s age.
2:Habitat decor.this way habitats would look more colorful and dragons would be happier with the habitat they are in.
3:Dragon figures.the figures would all be a baby version of a dragon but if that gets added,trainers could remember what their dragons looked like in the past.

These are some updates I think would be best for the game.If you could please add these,trainers expierence will be happier."
US	2	2020-10-18	5.7.1	REEEEEEEEEEEEEE hi	Fix this,it makes NO SENSE.	I was gonna breed the sunflower dragon but oh what do you know? I can’t because it’s plant and fire. Your basically saying I have to buy it with gems. BUT YOU CAN BREED FIRE AND WATER?! Makes no sense. AT ALL. Please fix this,it’s super unfair and makes 0 sense.

No new game update, didnt install the new ipados yet, just out of the blue! Constant crashing, cant even make it past 5 seconds of opening the app without crashing"
US	4	2020-10-18	5.7.1	Horrific Fox	Great game!	"I’ve been playing DML for years! (Albeit on another phone) 
While there are far too many ads every time you exit a screen it is a free mobile game so I cut it slack.
I have however caught a bug in the game
I upgraded my fire habitat and when it finished it won’t let me dismiss the scaffolding and the star no matter what I do! If there’s anyway to fix this that’d be great. Everything functions well, theres stuff to do, and there’s actual reason to play everyday and all day!
They don’t lock everything behind the VIP pass which is amazingly nice the VIP is only giving you extra stuff (even then you can buy it with in-game currency!) 
This game is super entertaining while it does have a few bugs and glitches I love the heck out of DML
Definitely recommend"
US	2	2020-10-18	5.7.1	Chibuikem chukwka	WHY YOU BAN PEOPLE.	Ok so when I stared playing this game is was happy but it now said I should  update but I don’t like update  but it kept on forcing me so I looked at you tube and a YouTube said innocent players are getting banned so plz fix it😕

I’m so glad you did it for the first year and it has been so long until I got this game. I love this app it is the best game I’ve ever played. I did a great job with the quests but this is the best game! I love this place and it has been a great game! See ya a another day.
US	2	2020-10-14	5.7.1	Anonymous truther	Good game but if you get a new phone YOU ARE SCREWED	I got a new phone and tried to download it and get everything back and I have to start over. I paid for things and everything. Now I have to start over. When the game says connecting to social media platforms will save your progress.

Were you can give each other dragons ( with coins, gems, even dragons ) you can trade with almost every thing. I think this update would make this game the best game ever!!!!
US	4	2020-10-11	5.6.3	GuitarPlayer829	Screen Freezes	This is a great game and I love playing it and honestly I think I’m addicted. But I’ve noticed that, after not even a minute of gameplay, the game stops working and is frozen and I have to close the game to fix it. But it just keeps happening over and over again, no matter how many times I close the app. Other than that I love the game!

And also when I upgrade me habitats it glitches like some habitats when I upgrade literally won’t let me the XP for it and I can’t upgrade it again cause it won’t let me press the upgrade option on the game.

US	4	2020-10-05	5.6.3	Drak Light 897	Awesome but..	It’s an amazing game but when you first buy premium pass, like I did, you should be able to have it for the others ones, because I don’t want to keep buying it over and over. Thank you if your reading this, and please make this change. This is also just my opinion.
US	3	2020-10-05	5.6.3	The ad so..	Is a amazing game But...	AD AD AD TO MUCH ....  the only way to stop this is by the vip pass  is easy to get but still  the vip pass it last for ONE DAY  so not sure what it will do for the ad But great game
US	5	2020-10-04	5.6.3	nalamadison8	Dragon ML	This is the best game ever because you kill me three eggs and you can buy eggs it’s easy to get all the money and the dragons are so cute
US	1	2020-10-02	5.6.3	Ultimate yes	Really?	This game actually reuses dragon skins they just put on a different costume. They also never put a third form for their dragons. They also didn’t put more than one type of attack for each element. The game becomes pretty crappy once you learn this so fix that for now one star I wish I could rate -99999999 stars.
US	5	2020-10-02	5.6.3	logannight	E	"So first I played this on my laptop which broke but I liked this game so much I could make a essay but short

US	2	2020-09-28	5.6.3	ShawnCarno	Listen	I love this game and all but I’m losin my mind. Can u plz stop pullin up stuff about vaping it’s really annoying. I’m trying to collect coins-“if you vape, you could be inhaling toxic metals into your lungs. Trying to hatch a dragon egg-“if you vape, you could be inhaling toxic metals into your lungs. Everywhere I go-“if you vape, you could be inhaling toxic metals into your lungs. LIKE OK I UNDERSTAND!!! I SWEAR THIS GAME HAS A GRUDGE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO VAPE!
US	5	2020-09-27	5.6.3	Dragonmaster266514	This game is amazing!	I spend all the of my time playing this game and I live it. I like the open minded plot and game play!
US	3	2020-09-27	5.6.3	#Catgurl	Don’t assume things	This is a great game, don’t get me wrong, but I hate your ads choices. When I put in my age ( I’m a teenager) you began showing me all these ads about not to smoke or vape and what the real cost is, I thought, “ Hey, its a one time thing.” Until those were the only ads I was seeing, you can’t just think that I’ll smoke or vape just because of my age, so please fix this, it just seems rude for you to think that I will vape or smoke. Thank you.
US	2	2020-09-27	5.6.3	Spicy58	Great Game But....	I have played the game going on 4 years.  It definitely keeps you busy.  So busy that to complete some events it is like having a part time job.  And even at that you still have to spend $$’s to get the prize dragon.  They make it impossible to complete an event without doing every task.  When the game started it was not this way but they have gotten greedy!
US	2	2020-09-26	5.6.3	Eviex0x0	Fun game, but can’t really enjoy unless spend money	"I’ve actually been playing for literal YEARS. You can advance with little-to-no money, but MANY dragons are off limits to you if you don’t pay. Also, many dragons off-limits if you don’t get non-players to join and use your friend code. Was okay with it to begin with, but honestly feeling it less and less more lately. Most weekly events you can’t come close to winning unless you spend on gems. Even the events they come out with lately require you to log in WAY too frequently and lengthy for ANY working, functioning, adult (let alone one with a family) to actually achieve events and successes in this game.

Basically? It’s a, now, semi-fun game that’s focused on being a MLM scheme for money."

US	5	2020-09-24	5.6.3	hippiehippocrate	So fun	I have been playing this game for 4 years. I stoped for a wile and then started back up again. This is the best game ever. I don’t want to lose my progress!!! When my mom gets a new phone (I am 11), I don’t think my progress will save. I am not starting over! Best game I have ever played, I hope it saves your progress. 👍🤗☺️😖 One thong though, I Play on a iPhone, and I can’t change my name. Also, it won’t let me make my own clan. Can you please make the legendary dragons easyer to breed? Anyways that, awesome game.
US	4	2020-09-24	5.6.3	icee3170	Ok game	This game is really finn and I have been playing it for a while.   I like that there are so many dragons to collect and how tou can battle with other people. The only thing not so good about the game is that for many dragons that are avalible for only a limited time cost real money and thats why most of the dragons I have are from brreding. I also don’t know why legendary and rarer dragons take more than 24 hours to hatch without using gems. Either than that this is a very good game.
US	5	2020-09-24	5.6.3	Heather Wings	I really like the game 👍	"I like this game because I get new dragon and I love the battles and the graphic of the game is nice and there’s no glitches in the game no bugs and I love getting to higher levels meeting friends , but I have a question, why is the game different on different device cause me and my cousin were playing but on her iPad it doesn’t let battle, the game battles for her ,but for me I battle /choose. 
And I been having this game for probably more than a month and I really enjoy the game, and my brother saw me playing it so he downloaded it also and now we can sent each other gifts and when I visit him I can help him with the time when I press t(e little clock thing I’m not sure what there called,

I love the game."

US	4	2020-09-23	5.6.3	Cat banana bread and butter	I love this game so much! But..	I love this game. It’s a great idle game to play when I have time. The dragons have really good designs and I like the humorous elements. However, there is one infuriating little problem I have. For months now there’s been an ad that almost never works for me. I can’t close it either without restarting the game. I think it’s a real cost ad? And there’s been a few times where it’s the only ad that I’ve gotten so I have to abandon whatever reward I’m attempting to get. For example, I’ve been trying to get my free card pack for at least half an hour but all I get is the ad loading screen. I hope this can be fixed, because the game itself deserves 5 stars :(
US	5	2020-09-22	5.6.3	Isabella_0513	Fun	love it, so fun so swag.
US	4	2020-09-21	5.6.3	Princess_Nanners7252	Dragons	I love dragons, so if you love them then this game is for you. Some of these dragons are really cute as baby's. The thing I don't like is all the notifications, yes I have the power to turn the notifications off but some of the notifications are not needed. But overall I love this game.
US	1	2020-09-21	5.6.3	XxKittyLoafxX	In-Game Purchase Errors Beware!	"The GL Team will resolve most issues when you report them, except for issues on their end related to purchases. Their reps will make any excuse to justify the error and refuse to rectify the situation. 

I purchased a Boss dragon who appeared in my inventory as a Legendary instead. They claimed I incorrectly purchased a Legendary, but really there was an in-game issue causing the Boss dragons to appear as Legendary, however when you hatch it, the Legendary was really a Boss. I was just lucky when I hatched it that the error resolved on its own. 

Next I had a promo for a 60 day extra breeding den for the same price as the 30 day den. When purchasing it, I only received 30 days instead of 60 days. The GL Team once again lied and came up with an excuse not to rectify the situation. I was told by the rep that not all promos are available to every player, but then why could I see it? They are full of it. 

Beware when making in-game purchases. If there is a problem with it, GameLoft will not correct it. They will just take your money. Bad business. Otherwise the game is fun. You’ve been warned!"

US	1	2020-09-21	5.6.3	Som-B0dy	Genuinely Bad	The only original thing this game has going for it is looks. Literally every other aspect is awful. I find it both hilarious and possibly intentional that this singular app has all the marks of a clear cash grab. You can’t play the game for 5 minutes without it popping up an add that closes the stupid game to shill to some company. Then there’s the criminal VIP status where you get free tickets but you can’t advance to “better” rewards without paying for gem packs. Then there’s the disrespectful season pass gimmick also known as give me money every month for stuff otherwise thrown in your face in the app. Have the creators even thought about the possibility of kids running their parents dry with this stuff? Like every couple days they’d be paying a hundred something dollars just to enjoy this pathetic excuse for an app.

But there is one problem I would like to be fixed the breeding time takes way to long and hatching the eggs take to long to.but it’s an amazing game please please get this game it’s so cool.you can Evan battle other MPs. It’s really fun pls get this game

US	4	2020-09-17	5.6.3	DeppressedWolf	A thing I don’t really like/ but the game is amazing	The game is amazing and it’s fun collecting and breeding dragons and doing dungeons and doing battles and stuff, but when you breed the dragons and you don’t get the egg you need/want, you have to wait a really Long time for it to hatch, then you have to sell it. I got a mud dragon egg and I need a clownfish egg, now I have to wait 10 hours for it to hatch, then I sell it. I kinda wanna give up. It takes forever and makes me kinda bored.  And it takes forever and makes me sad and I feel like it’s a waste of time :( I’m sorry if this makes you sad or anything, but this is a kind of complaint. I don’t really like it.

US	5	2020-09-16	5.6.3	Cass Webb	My opinion	Great game, it just has a little to many adds and it takes too long to wait for battles to breed and to hatch stuff other then that it’s great!
US	5	2020-09-16	5.6.3	Keslie Baldwin	New ideas.	We should be able to also merge our duplicate dragons on existing dragons to make them level up instead of just using outrageous amounts of food to level them up to the next level. I love this game, I’ve been playing it for around five years and I love the updates and everything, but I do think that margining dragons wouldn’t be such a bad idea either. Maybe in the next update?
US	1	2020-09-15	5.6.3	Som-B0dy	Here’s an idea	I’m gonna be honest, this game is fun. However it used to be more fun due to the absence of a few fundamental issues the game has now. For one remove the pop up ads and videos that appear within 2 minutes of opening the game that redirects you to Safari EVERY TIME because I’m pretty sure three programmed mid click. Second, remove the whole “Season Pass” ordeal, it’s a clear unoriginal cash grab that almost every other game I’ve played has done. What’s more the Season Pass is like 10 dollars a month ON TOP OF the VIP pass which though you win in game can never be upgraded to actually mean something without you guessed it paying. I understand that this is a free app, but shoving payments in your face and making it pay to win made the app that much worse in my opinion.
US	5	2020-09-15	5.6.3	Wesleyco	This a great game❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🖤🤍🤎🤎💖💘💝💝💕💞💓💗	Listen, this a fun, and addicting game. You can not stop playing this, I have lots of favorite dragons already. I even made up to bronze league two, thanks to my level 20 Harpy dragon and my level 19 fire dragon. I am not much of a fan of Dragon city, and I used to enjoy DragonVale also, DragonVale World isn’t really my jam anyways also. But this is the perfect dragon game for me. I also love the events, if it wasn’t for the event, I wouldn’t have able to bring my team to the next level. But I have question, how do you add sync moves to your dragons, I see everyone else in the arena with sync moves for their dragons. Can you please tell my how? But I love this game, awesome, if anyone is looking for a good dragon game, this is the perfect one for you.

US	1	2020-09-12	5.6.3	forpetesake	Used to be great! prizes in the game are cash only.	I’ve played every day since the beginning. I loved the game. They have continually made it harder until you need a PhD to play. Also it’s impossible to get anything good if you don’t want to pay lots of real money. I’m willing to a point but the real prizes are cash only.

US	3	2020-09-10	5.6.3	dissapointedreviewwriter	Great Game	This game is great and all, but there are several “glitches” that make it a little unpleasant. For one, sometimes I won’t be able to watch a video to get like faster breeding or hatching. It will say “Video not available. Check back later.” This always happens, and I don’t ever get the benefits that come with the videos. Another thing is the events. The monthly dragon has enough time, but the weekly dragons never have enough time. For one, multiple breeding sessions have to be done in order to get it, and not to mention how much time those take with the breeding and hatching. Other than that, this is a great game, and I definitely hope these glitches don’t effect everyone.
US	5	2020-09-10	5.6.3	Gogol7171	Better than Dragonvale and Dragon City	"If you’re considering getting this game, go ahead and get it. 

The graphics are great, the interactive feeding and petting dragons are adorable, the quests are fun with cute little storylines, and even the ads you watch for gems are interactive and enjoyable. 

Plus, the in-app purchases aren’t forced on you like in Dragon City and the gameplay is less complex and better quality than Dragonvale.

I’ll forever be annoyed about the waiting time for breeding and hatching eggs that all dragon games have, but that’s my only issue and that’s present in basically every other dragon game."

US	4	2020-09-08	5.6.3	friends bro	The great experience 🤗	It’s a lovely game but very violent to young kids but it’s a action and peaceful kind of game like life .You born in this world 🌎 and then raise as a human or animal 🦒.. but you should download this game love it 😊 hope you like it too 🤗🤗🤗🤗
US	5	2020-09-08	5.6.3	moonlight kitty1	Awesome but have some ideas	So at first I didn’t think I would play the game for that long but I eventually got so addicted that I played it literally every day. This game is awesome and I love the dragons there all so cool but I have a few ideas u could use. One it’s not really an idea but could u like take down  the hours a bit for the breeding and hatching I had to wait A WHOLE FRICKEN DAY while my breeding only took like 7 or something hours. And back the the breeding Could u make it so u could put the finished egg from the breeding den in the inventory for example my hatchery is hatching a dragon I already have for 13 hours and my breeding den is only gonna take 5 hours if I remember correctly. So those are just some ideas but other than that I love the game it’s AWESOME and you did amazing on it.
US	2	2020-09-07	5.6.3	Triple poo boo 17	Fun but too many adds and everything cost to much money	This is a nice game to play it has battling and you can hatch a lot of cool dragons but it also has its set backs. Like if your trying to breed a certain dragon and you put in the dragons with the right elements in the right order and it gives you the other on that’s not right if you put them in the right order you should get that exact dragon the first time. Also if you want to buy something with real money it’s always too expensive. The game always has sales but don’t let it fool you. the normal price is higher than it should be and then they put on sale to make you think your getting a good deal YOUR NOT. Also when you upgrade stuff it takes to long. But I like that you can upgrade as much as you want all at the same time.
US	5	2020-09-07	5.6.3	Peepawcookiebear	Excellent game but...	I mean, this game is one of my favorites of all times, but you can’t win any events without spending a LOT of money. For example, gems are pretty hard to get.

US	5	2020-09-06	5.6.3	JadeWinglet	My review	This game is really cool! I have a few recommendations though. It would be great if friends were allowed to battle and trade with each other.
US	5	2020-09-06	5.6.3	Mason Mario	AMAZINGGGGG	I like the EVERYTHING
US	5	2020-09-06	5.6.3	ares_043	The game is great	But like all the cool dragons the only way to get them is by using money or breed them but you have a 0.0000000000000000001 % chance to breed them
US	1	2020-09-06	5.6.3	Kbossert99	Social media	On iOS it will try to connect to my Facebook and say “collecting bonus dragon” and buffer. It’ll have a little WiFi symbol as if searching for network which will disappear. Then all it does is buffer. My android version doesn’t have that issue

US	2	2020-09-05	5.6.3	Sabbycats	Really good but with a fatal flaw	So i’ve played this game for about six years on an off. But it has a big problem. 9 times out of 10 it glitches and crashes on the loading screen. Uninstalling and reinstalling used to fix it, not anymore. Disappointed.
US	1	2020-09-05	5.6.3	rxvic	Can’t play without multiple interruptions	So many ads ! You end up spending all your time dodging ads or watching them. Not much of a game otherwise! War dragons is so much better! I think this game is repetitive and boring. Unless you enjoy ads?! Feel like that’s all this game offers. True to my issues with game loft! Had played seigefall for years they dumped the game and left everyone hanging but you can still spend $ of course. Will never play game loft games again. Only children who don’t care about wasting their time will enjoy this.
US	5	2020-09-05	5.6.3	Wesleyco	This a great game, but needs more updates	Listen, this a fun, and addicting game. You can not stop playing this, even though I just downloaded it. But I think you need to put better updates and I mean more. Also can please try to change the bee dragon a little also. It is kinda creepy.
US	1	2020-09-05	5.6.3	omg bro dont trust this	TRASH game	Horrible game can’t even find the language setting so it’s stuck in Chinese for the rest of the game controls are very difficult to get use to just a HORRIBLE GAME

US	1	2020-09-05	5.6.3	Shadeaflame	Too many ads	So having ads for a free game is fine. This game goes way over the top giving you one every five minutes. To make it worse they also have many in game purchases which I would have  accidentally bought if not for my settings. Over all one star who gives a kids game “no smoking ads” overall greedy company that is a dead game.

US	5	2020-09-03	5.6.3	steamer01	Dragon mania legends	The game is fun and so lifelike. Love the breeding and raising. I just wish at least parts of it would be internet free. We have limited wi-fi and I am only allowed to play for 1 hour in the mornings. Would love the freedom of playing off line.
US	5	2020-09-03	5.6.3	nayjib	Fun	This game is actually pretty fun
US	4	2020-09-03	5.6.3	izdet	Love the game! There's one thing.	I've been playing the game for months and months, But then one day, It stopped working. By that, I mean every time I join it, It crashes 2 seconds later. And if it lasts a long time, Its SUPER Laggy. Please fix it. I love this game and so it makes me disappointed that I can't play it anymore. Love you. ❤️
US	4	2020-09-02	5.6.3	DustStone	I love this game	This game is awesome and I love it but I don’t like how you can’t breed divine dragons and how long the time takes on the dungeon battle to try again besides that this game is really fun and would recommended it to everyone. Also plz join my clan WINGS OF FIRe thanks.

US	5	2020-08-29	5.5.0	#merdy	I’m addicted! 😍🐉	I’ve had this for four years and haven’t even looked at it, but a couple days ago I looked back at it and now I can’t stop! The dragons are so creative, and I love all the special things they add to keep it interesting. I love it and I wouldn’t change a thing.
US	2	2020-08-28	5.5.0	Happy-Chappy	How to change my user name	I can’t change it and once you get to high levels and well unlock everything there is like nothing you can do soo soo boring Also I would like to say that you need to have a chat thing soo you can chat with other players and then I can figure out how to send messages or gifts to friends. This game has potential but it needs work I know how hard it is to code everything I have coded some myself but i would like it if I could get some help on the whole master the game thing lol 😂 good luck and please take my advice it would make the game so much better!

US	1	2020-08-27	5.5.0	DivineFocus	Horrible, dragons take hours to breed.	Dragons take hours to breed, what the hell it's not like I'm going to play this game for 16+. It could of been minutes, NOT hours I do get that it's suppose to be realistic, also does anyone want to wait HOURS., It is just annoying when you get the wrong dragon, you can't cancel the breed you have to wait until it's done hatching. why can't I just cancel the breed?? Is it that hard to add it to your game? It just makes sense for you to be able to cancel the breed., I'll raise the stars up to 5 or 4 but that's if you do it.

US	1	2020-08-24	5.5.0	Heeeeeellllllooooo	Best before but worst  now this game is a bully	Worst game ever, it kicked me out of the game like 1,00000 times before this it was amazing I would give it 100 stars and I would recommend everyone to play this game but then when I won the dragon who has the elements of light, wind and mettle the when it was about to hatch it kicked me out and again and again so I deleted the game and redownload it the it asked me to download the background so I did when it is finished it kicked me out again then again again like 1,00000 times so then I quit I deleted the game if someone respond and tells me how to fix this the I will download this game again but if no one do until I die then if I was able to get back then I would remember this and NEVER downloaded this game ever again
US	5	2020-08-24	5.5.0	BLAKE11M	Best game	The Graphics are really good and it’s really hard to get good dragons but if you try hard you can get them pretty easily I have to do is level up those dragons all in all it’s a really fun game
US	5	2020-08-24	5.5.0	buttholes123456789	Excellent.	Hi I’ve been playing this for about 4 months and it’s alright I get to fight earn coins I have like 100M coins and like 100 diamonds and it’s alright it’s a fun game I recommend someone playing this thank you for reading this.

US	5	2020-08-21	5.5.0	catgirl5657	Best game of the year for me	I had gotten this game a few years ago but I had to delete it sense the update was just not working. Now I have it back and I still love the game but teeny problem: When you watch an add to speed the hatching/breeding times up, the game kind of stops and 5 seconds later it says that it sped up. It’s a little wonky and would be great if fixed. Overall it’s an awesome game. 😍Also is it just me, or does anyone else love to click on the islands you haven’t bought and just let them drag you? 😂edit: I went to breed the elephant dragon but it said I already had it even though it didn’t show that I did anywhere. I’m very confused.

US	5	2020-08-19	5.5.0	water ice fire and wind	Best game ever	This game is good and you should get it only you can buy different lands you can get new dragons like I do like the boiling dragon 🥳🥳😛😛
US	4	2020-08-19	5.5.0	Ttt89po	Good, but.	I love this game! There so many dragons to unlock, and being victorious in a battle is so satisfying! But the in-app purchases are to expensive! Even for a dragon with a halo. And it takes to long to do things! Breeding this dragon takes longer then building the academy. On one hand its😃💕. And on the other hand it’s🕧💲.
US	2	2020-08-19	5.5.0	SilverFoxx81739	Could be WAY better	"This game needs a easier way to earn gems... also less adds. I find myself going to tap on something- add
Closing out of said thing i wanted to tap on and had opened after add-add!
ADDS R DRIVING ME CRAZY NOW!
Also, the breeding system makes no sense! I was trying to get the sprite dragon, got a boiling dragon, then right after that a horror dragon! Why!?!?! The breeding should go up in tiers like some games do! That is just plain messy! The chance of me getting the sprite dragon is low because of this wonked out breeding system is! Its most likely a random generator, but still, the higher the lvl the dragon is should cancel out the chance of getting starter dragons tbh, it doesnt matter the lvl i think, its just random! I lvl up my dragons after getting a early on dragon for the game and find myself getting a even worse dragon that before...
It is just messy and there is no way to know what you need to do for your chances to be higher to get a better dragon, and that needs to be fixed, i stopped playing this game for months in end because of things like that! I like the multi games in one game but... just less adds and better breeding system and a bit easier way to get gems would make this game way more fun!

-Sincerely a Random YouTuber who has weird interest!

(P.S please think about making those functions better! If you ever do thank you!)"

There’s a lot of battles: Campaign Map, Arena, Enchanted, Dungeon, etc. There’s so much to this! The only thing I don’t like is the applying things to EVERY SINGLE ONE of your dragons!! But I love the game otherwise!

US	4	2020-08-15	5.5.0	ylmzsahin	Love it	I love this game I am addicted to it but I think it can use a few updates. I think it could use a little work because it take hours to receive eggs and breed dragons. Also, I think it can update the fact you need to pay with real money to receive the boss dragons you battle. I would suggest buying it with coins in the game, about 10,000 coins would be fair, and I think it could be great if it would extend the energy tank to 7 because it’s so annoying after 3 battles I have to wait 25 minutes. All in all I think this game is amazing, keep up the good work!

US	5	2020-08-15	5.5.0	TayTotTime26	Edited Review	I love this game. Collecting dragons and making a great island are just a few of the reasons. It's way better than dragon city. I've tried so many times to play that game, but it just isn't very fun like this game. I've been playing for about 3 years now, and it provides challenges and some easy stuff. It's not pay-to-win like some of the reviews say. The ads aren't that bad either. Give it a try!

P.S. Cthulhu is a god like creature and the gargantuan leviathan is in a game named subnautica which is a awesome game I should prob stop typing and get to me playing your magnificent game
US	5	2020-08-14	5.5.0	Meyercoyour	Radiation/Nuclear type Dragons?	So, while a majority of the types of dragons are based on elements, I was wondering if maybe Radiation or Nuclear type Dragons might be added into the mix? We already have legendaries and divines, so why not try a more volatile type? Perhaps the Radiation/Nuclear type Dragons have abilities similar to the plant base, only if the dragon is already suffering a poison or radiation, it can cause a bonus of some extra damage while also having one of the major abilities working similar to Infection? It’s just a thought though.

US	3	2020-08-11	5.5.0	ffckghu	It’s impossible	So I just downloaded this game today and I bought a lava dragon and I had to open habits for a fire and a earth habit but it did not let me put that dragon in a habit it says the limit of that habit has been hit
US	5	2020-08-10	5.5.0	hsvdvdgdvdg	The best game	This game has the cutest dragons every and now I play every day
US	5	2020-08-10	5.5.0	millaWINN	This game is cool	You can get a lot of dragons collect them all get cool dragons train your dragons to fight other players all over the world get legendarys epics this is why this game is the best
US	5	2020-08-10	5.5.0	well it could be better	Excellent game but there’s a few problems.	I love this app, it’s been one of my favorite apps for years, but Lately I’ve found a glitch (I have no idea if this is only mę or,) this glitch has made mę really, really frustrated. This glitch happens when I try to buy something I’ll click it then I’ll buy it, but I don’t get anything all I get is a message saying “please try again later *(error)* (code 435262(352535)” it really makes mę frustrated when this happens but other then this it’s a very well put together game!
US	5	2020-08-10	5.5.0	uh rceuhdnceugfbcgeufc	WOW	Best game ever! ❤️
US	5	2020-08-10	5.5.0	catgirl5657	Best game of the year for me	I had gotten this game a few years ago but I had to delete it sense the update was just not working. Now I have it back and I still love the game but teeny problem: When you watch an add to speed the hatching/breeding times up, the game kind of stops and 5 seconds later it says that it sped up. It’s a little wonky and would be great if fixed. Overall it’s an awesome game. 😍Also is it just me, or does anyone else love to click on the islands you haven’t bought and just let them drag you? 😂
US	4	2020-08-10	5.5.0	fugyvgf	Ads	Love this game but I hate ads
US	5	2020-08-10	5.5.0	aertyertdsaegcvzyertchis	Good	I relly like this game there not to manny adds😂😂😀😀😀😀😃😀😀😃😁 and it’s really fun 😄😄the only thing I don’t like is when you breed a dragon it take 10hours 😡😡😡😡😭😭😭😭then when you get the egg it takes 6 hours ☹️☹️☹️😡😡😡😡😭😭😭that’s all I don’t like but don’t get me wrong it’s a really like this game
US	1	2020-08-10	5.5.0	Arctic turtle78	DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!!!	This game is seriously terrible. There are only a small handful of cool dragons and there are SO MANY ADS!! Instead of getting this game, please get Socialpoint’s very amazing Dragon City. It is much better.
US	1	2020-08-10	5.5.0	XxKittyLoafxX	Pay To Play	Don’t even think for a moment this isn’t pay to play game. You don’t get nearly the advantage the plays who spend hundreds of dollars do and even then.... GL Team is shady as hell. Don’t expect to get any worthwhile dragons unless you’re willing to shell out $600 plus per event.
US	5	2020-08-10	5.5.0	Doggirl1098765	I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH	OKAY I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAM EAND CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT YOU GUYS DID A AMAZING JOB WITH THIS GAME. But I have a suggestion the game can have an event where you can pay for gems with coins instead of real money the event can last two days.
US	1	2020-08-09	5.5.0	jwrkmn	Ridiculous	This is ridiculous. I understand wanting to make money on the game, but the developers have made everything too expensive. I finished the dungeon and spent the 2000 on the final chest, but it wasn’t worth it. I only have to make or buy 28000 more to get the dragon. Not to mention my own daughter put in my friend code and it never added her to my friends list. Plus I tried to link my Facebook account and it said that it is linked, but again, no dragon

Overall it’s an awesome game. 😍Also is it just me, or does anyone else love to click on the islands you haven’t bought and just let them drag you? 😂

I don’t have Facebook, but I still want to have the same game as before. I had great dragons and have spent money on this game multiple times. I don’t want to give up trying to get this game back. Help or advice would be VERY appreciated. Thank you. Still 8 months later and I can’t login. HELP ME.

I’ve decided to restart. Nothing helped."
US	5	2020-08-06	5.5.0	Miss Kristi	SO MANY ADS	When I first started playing this, the ads were far and few between, and I could choose to watch an ad to earn gems or coins, etc. Now it seems like every time I move across the board an ad pops up. It makes me spend less time on the game because it’s sooo annoying. I used to love this game and the pop ups are making me consider quitting the game altogether

This game used to bring me so much joy when I played it on my moms phone when I was like seven and I remember collecting all the dragons and islands and beating the campaign, and just how much fun it was but I completely forgot about it then I got an add today and I started playing again! It’s a wonderful game and nothing has changed. Still the great game it used to be! Great work GameLoft!

US	5	2020-08-03	5.4.1	katelyn232425	I have a problem	I keep getting a loading screen and I’m not the only person with this problem I think there needs to be less adds if they want to do adds they should make it so we get small rewards instead of just springing it on us because some of us have pore WiFi and it causes us not to be able to play the game. Just a bit annoying.

My WiFi is bad as it is so the ads just make it worse it takes foreverrrr to load and I’m just sitting there waiting for an ad to load. I’ve been playing this game for a while and I can tell how many ads the game as gotten. It never had this many ads before so why all the ads now? Not to mention an ad pops up every 6 minutes like gosh it feels like I’m watching ads more than I’m playing the actual game now.

      The game itself is fine, but it uses the most wildly inappropriate ads! I was playing the game myself when I ran into this awful ad with way mature content. I didn’t do one of those “watch this ad and get this free stuff” it just came! Totally ruined my day! 
      It’s not worth it: learn from my mistakes and DONT GET THIS APP!!! Don’t do it!"
US	5	2020-07-24	5.4.1	WheezyV	Amazing game but I have suggestions	"First of all, it’s a great game. The battle layout is more unique than other games, for example Dragon City. I also find the concept of the Dragon Academy good.
I have a suggestion: it would be cool that if we end a battle with out dragon fury bar full, that would be converted into dragon fury essence. (I don’t use the essence but still, this would be nice.) if dragon fury essence bottles are too valuable for this, it would be also cool if it was turned into a shard of dragon fury essence, & you needed a certain amount of these shards to craft 1 whole dragon fury essence.
Thanks for reading!"
US	3	2020-07-24	5.4.1	rbenn5514	Ads	I understand why Ads, but the Ads pop up and have no way of closing them. If I elect to view an Ad for more Gems they have an X. Not the ones that pop up randomly. They make me exit the game every time.😩

However I have discovered a glitch, I’m not sure if this is happening to anyone else but whenever I get the notification that my daily reward is ready to collect I’ll click it and it takes me to the app but when it opens the daily reward screen doesn’t pop up. This has been happening for the last 2 days. Please fix this. In conclusion I love this game and I can’t wait to see where it goes in the future.

US	5	2020-07-21	5.4.1	It's not bad not bad at all	Nice👌	I really like it super addicting I love my dragons and I'm hoping to gat the agent one because I'm still pretty much a noob but I love the game really fun
US	4	2020-07-21	5.4.1	jxdzn123	Awesome	Amazing game
US	4	2020-07-21	5.4.1	Viventel	My favorite game! But.	"I love this game, I’ve been playing for about two-three years now! I love almost every aspect to it!
The waiting times don’t seem over-exaggerated, the amount of gems you can earn in a day is extremely helpful, and it’s easy to level up quickly with the help of a good clan and active friends.

However there’s one-two issues I would like to address.
1. Advertisements
Yes! I am completely okay with advertisements! However those “The Real Cost” ones are clunky, laggy, and altogether don’t fit the general speed of the game, makes me frustrated. The newer looking advertisements that you’ve added are much better and have actually grabbed my attention once or twice! I know it’s not up to you about what TRC does with their advertisements, but I’d suggest talking to them about upgrading/updating their ads. It’s simply not a vibe.
2. Quest issues
The quest system you have set up is pretty good! However there’s a little flaw in the main quests. Instead of checking if you have already completed the quest ahead of time and just giving you the reward, you have to rebreed dragons to get ones you’ve already gotten before. Once you’ve done that THEN it gives you the reward, which in my opinion, is pretty frustrating.

Again, this is my favorite game, but I would love love LOVE if you would help change these “issues” I’ve encountered? Thanks! <3"

US	5	2020-07-20	5.4.1	mch110	Can I give this 6 stars?	So, first things first, I LOVE this game. There is something like 714 dragons to get, and it never gets boring.  But I think it would be cool if you could trade with people, and trade stuff like some gems, relics, dragons, habitats, pretty much any thing. This would make the game so fun! Thank you!

US	5	2020-07-18	5.4.0	gold widow	Best dragon game	Hi I love dragon mania legends because it’s so fun. But that is not what I am here for. I am here because I have a a few ideas .my idea is a day and night cycle. And a weather affect . What the day and night cycle would do is that’s it would turn night and day so when it is night the dragons would be asleep and on the day they would be awake . The weather affect is where it would rain or thunder storm or it would snow . That’s all my ideas hope you like it and that you would put the weather Affect and day and night cycle🤗.

It be cool if y'all made a zoo breeding game in the future just like this but animals 

Keep up the good work.

US	5	2020-07-13	5.4.0	dog-lover2018	Good Game	So this is a really good game. But I have a suggestion... can we trade with friends? Like maybe you need a certain level to trade with friends (friendship level). I have a hard time breeding some dragons and being able to trade would be awesome especially for people who breed or have 2 of the same dragon. Maybe you have to feed the dragon to level up ( restart its level?) I think the whole idea of trading would be cool. Especially when you need a certain item.  Another thing I feel should be changed is the fact that you need  three lvl. 80 dragons to enter or continue into the Elite League. If a trainer can get into the Elite league without lvl. 80 dragons that means they can do it. Plus if they’re “not good enough “ they’ll probably drop leagues. (This is from my understanding. I’m in the Dragonscale League 2 )  But overall this is a 5/5 game. People have said that you can’t get far in the game without paying but i haven’t payed anything and I’m a level 43. So yeah, this is a great game. But like any other game you’ll need dedication to be able to get further into the game. 🥰✌️
US	1	2020-07-13	5.4.0	XxKittyLoafxX	In App Purchase Scams	"Beware! You will sometimes see in-app purchases that will disappear and suddenly show either a higher price, a lower qty of items for the same price or disappear altogether when you try to make the purchase. When emailing customer service, they are not able to reinstate the promo with them stating, “[their]Team doesn’t have any technical capacity to adjust or extend a promo offer once it&#39;s over.” 

For example, an extra breeding den for 60 days at $4.99 was on my screen. When I tried to make the purchase, it disappeared and only showed the same price but for 30 days. I was told by the Rep that it was my fault, that I must not have had the funds or my credit card wasn’t setup properly, neither of which were true. I made the 30 day extra den purchase, since that was the only option left, and that went through just fine. 

In further communication with the Customer Service Rep, they tossed a measly 30 gems at me for my inconvenience and called it resolved. I replied back and presented a completely valid way for them to rectify the situation and the Customer Service Rep flat out refused by saying, “ Unfortunately, we can&#39;t send you Extra Den relic tokens.” That’s a lie. There is a thing called Extra Den Relic Tokens in the game, which they could have sent 30 Relic Tokens and called it square, as I had already paid the $4.99 promo price. 

Just beware of scams! The Team who develops this game are only out to make money, which is most games with in-app purchases, however this Team will scam you out of your money and refuse to rectify the situation appropriately."

But here is why it does not get the last star: 
The game is great! But I would love if we get to make our very own dragon, customize, name it, design the egg, name the dragon type and share it for others to breed, find, or get some other way, then hatch it! And we could only pick 2 elements for it! Would that not be cool?!"

It’s insane to me that data can not be transferred from an android device to an iOS device. I personally love this game but started on an android switch to an iPhone and can’t transfer my data. Why log into fb to save progress then not be able to up that progress on a different operating device. Ridiculous. Fix this please!!!!!!!!!!!!! It would get a 5+ rating if I could just transfer my data"

US	5	2020-07-09	5.4.0	Immagoanddie	Great game	This game is very good it’s a little grindy but not too much. Also it’s very free to play and it doesn’t ask you to watch adds every second only just to get a few gems. Very fun and this should be the dragon game everyone plays instead of dragon city.
US	4	2020-07-09	5.4.0	njsbddhndhd	Good game but there’s a problem	"First of all very good game best game I have ever played but there’s a problem the problem is that the only way to get the event dragons are to spend money or just be really good in the game 
which takes one two years or even three years which is a very long
Time my opinion is to make a event that is not almost impossible 
to complete"
US	4	2020-07-09	5.4.0	Lana Yuna	Good game, but too many ads	"I’ve played this game before a few years ago, and decided to play it again. The game play is just like I remembered. Simple, cute, and pretty graphics.
My only complaint is that there are way too many ads. Even with a VIP membership, there are ads. It would be awesome if they made an one-time payment to remove ads or add the no ads feature when you have VIP. Most of the ads tend to freeze and I have to keep on closing the app and reopening it again. It can get frustrating after a few times. :/"

US	5	2020-07-08	5.4.0	Sienna David	Great Game	Dragon Mania Legends is a wonderful app to have! Not only is the gameplay very entertaining, but the graphics are really pleasant to look at. My only complaint is that there are way too many ads that pop up out of no where. It is very annoying after a while. However, other than that I have no complaints! It isn’t too difficult to get rare dragons, but enough of a challenge to be happily surprised when you do breed one. The battles slowly incline in difficulty as the player progresses, making it a fun addition to the game. The PVP is also very entertaining and I enjoy it very much. Overall, very good game. Once again, my only complaint is that there are a lot of ads.

I have been trying for 6 months but you have never resolved this problem so I might delete this game.

But I don’t really like the addition of “sigils” I think they just make battling overcomplicated and confusing. Other than that, I really have no problems with the game, and I would recommend it to everybody. What are you waiting for? Go download it and start your dragon adventure!  :)

US	5	2020-07-06	5.4.0	dimøndwolf	honestly a great game	"i’m enjoying this game a lot, super fun and addicting to play
some things i like about this game are the battling mechanics like the weaknesses and strengths with the elements, and the variety of rarities and dragons
i also love the dragon designs because all of them are unique and eye catching, like the breeze rock, harpy, pixie, etc
the events and sales are great too because the events can give you cool dragons, some event dragons you have a chance to get from breeding too and the sales are pretty self explanatory, stuff is % off and the highest i’ve seen is 81% off for a dragon pack (food, dragon, coins, etc) i don’t know if they are called dragon packs i just made that up
suggestion: i think for the battling something should come up at the top of the screen for the turns if that makes any sense, like your dragons icon when it’s your dragons turn? not sure if that makes any sense whatsoever but just a suggestion
overall i definitely recommend this game and it really lives up to its ratings and the rating i’m giving it now, goodbye and enjoy the rest of your day"

Just to make it clear it is... It SO SUPER IS!!! If your looking for reasons and answers keep reading the review. 1 Question: Does the game work? It does. No crashes. No glitches or lag. Question 2: Is it fun or boring? FUN!!! But beware it’s addicting... So basically it’s SUPER FUN and it IS!!! Question 3: Space? How much space does it take? Well it takes space all games do! It does not take that much but it will take quite a bit of space once you have thousands of dragons! Question 4: Any in app purchases? Yep. But if your on a amazon device you can configure with parent controls and turn of purchases I think... I’m pretty sure!!! Well there is only 1 ONE bad thing: You never will delete this game. :) Nope... NEVER you will have this game FOREVER once you download it! Just a heads up."

The only thing that bothers me is that there's so many side buttons and events and quests that surround the screen that it gets a little busy and confusing. Maybe all of the purchaseable packs could show up once as an ad and then go to the main shop and not appear as another button on the game's main screen? 
Other than this, love it!"
US	3	2020-07-04	5.4.0	Anonymous 4822	****** ads	I would’ve luved to give 5 stars. But the ****** ads ruined the experience for me. There’s consecutive ads that i can’t close. So i have to restart the game. Awful. I understand ads but game loft has taken ads way too far. Red line crossed. So unless you enjoy ads that you can’t close. Don’t go for it. Get it on the pc instead. But the game it self is phenomenal. Excellent. Great job. Hate the ads

US	5	2020-07-02	5.4.0	jekshsiz	Why does I take so long	Why does it take 11 hours for one dragon why does it take so long I rated it five stars so they can see my review but why on my right cheek does it take so long for no reason  the dragon can be trash or a duplicate and it takes one day for me to find out so make it shorter or don’t have a timer
US	5	2020-07-02	5.4.0	dfbvkjtyupoc	A great dragon game	This is a great dragon with so many islands tons of dragons especially the events
US	5	2020-07-02	5.4.0	snake lo	I love this app it makes my life easier for me and my family	Thank you so very much I will do my next weekend and get my hair cut tomorrow into the name of the app
US	3	2020-07-02		Hdk0808	Great but has a flaw	It’s a really fun game but it has a problem. Their are some dragons in game that cost $100. And gems cost a lot so even if you didn’t need a dragon that costed money and you didn’t have gems you would still need to send potential a potential $100 even still. It would be really nice if legendary dragons cost $20 like sometimes in dragon city.

US	4	2020-06-30	5.4.0	Candycorn30	Not many complaints-	The game runs smooth and the graphics are amazing! But I do hate all the ads. Mostly hate that I have to specifically watch a a vape ad every few minutes. Don’t get me wrong I know you can press the x on the top right corner but it gets pretty annoying and takes fun away from the gameplay. I’d love to know if there is a way to maybe pay to take the ads away? Anyways this overall is an amazing game and I highly recommended!
US	5	2020-06-30	5.4.0	DeCoded_Dragons	Great game	I’ve had this game for almost a year, and I’m almost level 55 and I have not had to spend a single dollar on it. It’s easy but not as easy as to make it boring. Gems could be a bit easier to get. The animation is really good and smooth, which I always appreciate in a game. I realize the bundles where you can get a dragon and gems/gold can only be bought with real money because this game probably needs money to work, but if they could be less expensive that’d be great.

US	4	2020-06-28	5.3.0	beani7958	Awesome game but..	The overall game is awesome and fun. There’s just one little problem WHY DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT SO LONG FOR SOMETHING TO UPGRADE OR HATCH A NEW DRAGON! I’m sorry I sound harsh but it’s true. No one and I mean NO ONE wants to wait 1226488507998374795998288477576 hours for there new dragon or building to be ready
US	5	2020-06-28	5.3.0	beta :3	Very nice, calm relaxing!	I really enjoy the part of the game where you will be at the lobby/ dungeon and the music will stop briefly, and ocean sounds will play. I just really like that. This is also the kind of game I would always be down to play if I where bored. I do not need to use my brain, I don’t need to do anything hard, and even then when the game is hard it isn’t annoyingly hard, it’s even more fun. I have been playing this game for as long as I can remember. I do think there are things that could change but I only have like 1 or 2 things, and even then they are not in specific, so I’ll leave that out and give it 5 stars.

US	5	2020-06-24	5.3.0	Maysan MacMeekan	How can I get to TOP3  very fast with keyword?！Where can I get the cheapest IOS app installs?	low average rating and negative reviews, could have an incredibly awful effect on your app.UPmobi.xyz(com) provide service for the app on app store and play store, we can provide Rating/Review/Keyword Installs for almost all the areas on both stores.Keyword  Installs campaigns would also increase your app’s keyword  rankings and bring you the organic audience.Please understand that ASO or App Store Optimization constitue some of the things that you can do while publishing your app. As most of the app installs occur via app store search, you need to earn the best ranking possible for your app and make it appear at the top (may be top 10,20 or 50). And to do that you need substantial 4 and 5 ratings. It is better if they are accompanies by comments as well.
US	4	2020-06-24	5.3.0	boo bear 23445	It is an a fun game	I love how cool and detailed the dragons are but it definitely does take a long time to get some of them to hatch but I guess that’s part of the game anyway also a lot of stuff costs money and no one’s going to buy that
US	4	2020-06-24	5.3.0	Som-B0dy	Here’s an idea	I’m gonna be honest, this game is fun. However it used to be more fun due to the absence of a few fundamental issues the game has now. For one remove the pop up ads and videos that appear within 2 minutes of opening the game that redirects you to Safari EVERY TIME because I’m pretty sure three programmed mid click. Second, remove the whole “Season Pass” ordeal, it’s a clear unoriginal cash grab that almost every other game I’ve played has done. What’s more the Season Pass is like 10 dollars a month ON TOP OF the VIP pass which though you win in game can never be upgraded to actually mean something without you guessed it paying. I understand that this is a free app, but shoving payments in your face and making it pay to win made the app that much worse in my opinion.

US	2	2020-06-23	5.3.0	Mama Coey	Too much happening	"There is too much thrown in, up-front with unclear instructions. You just have to have an eidetic memory, or just figure it out as you go. The dragon characters are great, the babies are cute and growing them is straight forward; feed them. You can train them, but the purpose of training is unclear. It doesn’t seem to make a difference in the actual battles. 
These battles are simple enough to figure out, but there’s too many different quests happening at once. Battles, side quests, cave exploration, pirate ship exploration, school (again, can’t figure out what the point of school is, this is separate from training 🤷🏼‍♀️), and then occasionally there are flying creatures like annoying mosquitoes that you kill, but no shop to use their corpses in, so mostly they’re just annoying.
It just feels like the developer has ADHD with no one to temper their decisions.
Great concept, great art, too much happening at once."

US	4	2020-06-22	5.3.0	The real Sir.Pineapple	Amazing game	This game is truly amazing, perfect in every way, it has many different events you could play, and different fights too. There is an issue for me though and also for my sister. We keep getting vaping ads, over and over again, like every 5 minutes or so. It would be fine if it was other ads, but it’s as if they want me to vape instead of not doing it. I could recite the whole ads that they do, because they show up that much. To add recently there was an event where you played and got dragon things so you could end up winning a dragon. When the event finished I didn’t get a dragon or even get a prize, I’m confused I don’t know if it’s with my level or something else that caused this.
US	1	2020-06-22	5.3.0	Ilovekittycatmore	You didn’t give me the dragon for the event	I just joined and had three days to get the dragon, I got 2nd place for getting the epic dragon and now the game  me anything and no prizes. I basically hate this rigged game, please fix this problem for the matching game.
US	4	2020-06-22	5.3.0	Dragon slayer67	This game is awesome	This game is full of adventure and it is so cool because you can battle but it’s not fair because some people just use money to win but in all it’s amazing

The next day came I didn’t get a single thing. Also months ago in dragon ml I brought a fruit tree that cost 200 gems. I thought that 200 gems is worth it but it disappeared 4 days ago. It was a waste of gem and a waste of my time for the dragon. I complained about these is because I think this app need to fix a bit or else it is a good game.

US	3	2020-06-22	5.3.0	wolfygirl10000000	It’s ok	"I like the game a lot but there’s a few things I think game creators could fix and add
Starting with the adds .i know u have to make money some how in games but I don’t think games with more than 5 adds per minute is the way to go . If u the creators were to give less adds I would be satisfied.But some of the positives are the game is well  created  and has great qualities to it like the academy and overall I play this game 5 times a day Evan with all the adds so good job creators claps to you .NO MORE ADDS !"

I really really love this game but there is a thing or two I think you should change, like having to buy stuff, I would absolutely love the game even more if you didn’t make people (like me) pay for diamonds or coins. It makes me angry when I have to wait 12-14 hours for a special dragon to hatch. Anything other than that is awesome!

I think you should change the adds to something else besides vaping because it could give the the kids the wrong message, anyone else?

US	3	2020-06-20	5.3.0	LaffyTaffy2020	Yo	Yet again I have found a problem. Well, not “I”. More like my younger sibling. They noticed that to speed up a, lets say 6 hour breeding thing, you have to pay at LEAST 30 gems to speed it up! Its really unfair, and while it is like 6 games in one, that is totally and completely blocked out by the amount you have to pay to advance. Who’s gonna waste their hard earned gems to speed something up only to have it be a dragon they already have! And don’t get me started on the exploring thing. I got two shards side by side, and then for the last 5 - Yes, 5! - months, nothing! This game is rigged to the point where it’s becoming incredibly boring and repetitive. Plus, all the pop-ups for the events and stuff crowd my already-small screen. I already wrote about the designs, so I’ll give you a quick summary: They 👏 are 👏 all 👏 the 👏 same! The bases are copy and pasted, and then the details and colors are changed. Want an example? Take a look at the Lava dragon. Then take a look at the Geiger dragon. The exact same, only recolored! Its the same for the Orange and Melon dragons, as well as the Ice and the Emerald. Seeeeeeriously, if you’re going to make a game that is 6 games in one, at least make different designs! Thanks for reading my rant about this barely-even-thought-out slightly decent game. I mean no offense and I’m not trying to be rude, just giving out criticism.
US	4	2020-06-20	5.3.0	Obsidian15	Only one downside	This game is amazing but it has one downside. I have to pay one gem for every minute that I want to skip! I think that this is SO unfair. In a different game, I pay only one gem for each hour that I want to skip! This game is great, but I hope that this will get fixed.

This happens a lot. I don’t know what is going on, but it is weird. Can someone tell me what is going on? I don’t think it has happened to any one but me. This is a serious problem. Please fix this. It is very annoying.

US	3	2020-06-17	5.3.0	ditntnjssbdnjd	Updates ruin it	This is literally my favorite game ever! But they keep making bad updates to it that completely ruin everything. I miss the original and simple game because you could battle, collect dragons, decorate, and expand your world. Now there is all of these complicated things and the updates make it harder and harder to collect the dragons that you want. Overall it’s a pretty fun game but I wouldn’t recommend if you don’t like tons of change.

US	1	2020-06-16	5.3.0	CoD Fan47	Don't install. Crash city	How do you destroy a game in one update??  Release a game without testing it.  This was a good game but with the June update it crashes all the time.  The dragons don't want to fight you, their new campaign you cannot win if your a new player, you are trying to fight dragons 10 -15 levels beyond you.  I know it's a pay to win game, but make it fun.  I restarted the game 8 times already today because of ad crashes and game just  locking up.  To many times I loss all my progress and had to start over, but It took away my energy bar so I had to wait to do it later.   It thinks you loose wifi but my wifi is good, except this game.  It does not know how to cloud sync.  Not a lot of fun right know.

US	5	2020-06-15	5.3.0	😴🤨🤪🏵🌂❄️😬🥇😎🥪	Excelente but Too much adds	This game is very good but has to much adds
US	3	2020-06-15	5.3.0	1.1.1.1.1.1,1	fun but annoying	I have found with the new update that the signals are very pointless and it defeats the purpose of the battles for me. The gems are so hard to get and I don’t want to pay to gems since it’s so expensive. And many things are so expensive that are needed like the habitats  and certain dragons and the wait time is just crucial. Please change these things or I quit.
US	4	2020-06-15	5.3.0	Aryan Cimala	Awesome game but one idea	I love the game but there should be a way to restart because I played this game once and then had to restart on another device but I went to fast on the tutorial and I can’t restart so if you made a change to this I would be very happy.
US	5	2020-06-15	5.3.0	Lillie games	Nice game, little in fair	So, it is very hard to get diamonds. They put for to much.
US	5	2020-06-15	5.3.0	awsesome sause	It is really fun	"It is relaxing and easy to learn to play. You can discover hundreds of new dragons and duh, who doesn’t love dragons!!!? I love the music too and the mysteries like the chronos dragon. So cool!!! 
 Ha! The review wrote itself 🤣😂. I didn’t write the top paragraph but it is very true of how I feel about the game. Maybe I started writing months ago, maybe that is why I don’t remember. Anyways, I have been playing dragon mania legends for over a year and I think it is awesome. Something that the game review doesn’t show is that you can join clans and find new friends! Oh and the dragon population is way over 350. I’m sorry but you might want to update that dragon mania legends creators. No hate or anything but you might want to show how awesome the game is by telling people how many awesome dragons you can collect, OVER 700! CRAZY! Well it is really 695 or 697 but if you collect a few special ones then you can get over 700. One person on the game has over 704 dragons! I have almost 100 when I am writing this. By the time you read this it might be more. I’m going off topic let’s get back. DragonManiaLegends is an amazing game although There is this weird thing that there are some days you play the game there are a lot of ads. I hope they fix that in the next update. That is why I am updating my review and I didn’t remember that I wrote the first paragraph because I was waiting for my game to update. But I think you should really get the game and just get it, it has almost 5 stars and honestly it deserves it.

There is one more thing about This though. I have been reading other people’s comments and I do have to say that I agree with some of the bugs that they say like how it is hard to save up gems 💎 and hatching/breeding takes forever but they have helped with that by adding some new tokens that speed up stuff like the hatching token can speed up to 8 hours of hatching and there is a breeding token and a quest token where it speeds up quests and I think there is one more. It might be related to food, I’m not sure but DML sure has helped with that issue. But it still takes forever to get gems. There is a habitat with a big purple or pink tree that gives you free food every day so That also helps with the food but it is 200 gems 💎 so save up! 😬 

I still give it 5 stars though because it appears there are some things the creators have done to help with these issues but if you save 200 gems to get the pink tree habitat it is totally worth it. From what I saw you could get up to 1 million food a day! I AM SAVING UP! I currently have 120 gems."
US	5	2020-06-15	5.3.0	trashkinglmfao	random guy	This game is so fun like it’s the most dragon game :)
US	4	2020-06-15	5.3.0	Red robin dude is on this app	A great-ish game.	"This is by far the best dragon game I have had, but I have only had two, and that being said, there is just one thing that bugs me.

Some of the things you can buy with the gems you earn in this app are way over priced. Because of how hard it is to earn gems, and how expensive the dragons, buildings, and eggs are, it isn’t really fair. Let’s say you grow a baby dragon, and when it is grown, you put it up on a fight with  another dragon, your prize is food, gold, and very rarely gems. What I am trying to say is that it’s hard to get gems in even fighting, and fighting/making your dragons battle is hard enough as it is, but to rarely get gems from even that?

Now let’s talk about some thing else that isn’t so positive. What I don’t like is that it takes forever to hatch a egg, I’m sitting here right now and have been waiting more than 14 hours to hatch a egg, and I am new! So if I am new, it shouldn’t take over 14 hours to hatch/breed a starter egg. Imagine how long it must take to hatch a legendary egg.

And now let’s talk about some good things I like and enjoy about this app. What is different about this app is the dragons, the person who designed these cartoony/realistic look have talent! I would recommend it if you like the looks and styles of things like that.

What I also enjoy about this app is the ideas that the creator had for the set-up. It’s so cool that there are multiple islands you can take over and make into yours.

Over-all, it’s a pretty nice game, I would definitely recommend it if you like things like it."

US	5	2020-06-15	5.3.0	hnutt24	So great	It is so much fun
US	3	2020-06-14	5.3.0	Lowercasejae	Review	The game is amazing but when I got the first dragon you get as a reward it had the plant element which I still didn’t have so when I had a water dragon egg I had to sell the daily reward dragon to hatch that and there was no other way to get the daily reward dragon so I would never complete the dragon collection because I would never get that dragon. I  deleted the game because of that plant element dragon that I had to sell. You can add a thing where you can store the dragons you don’t have room for until you can put them somewhere so you can fix this problem.
US	1	2020-06-14	5.3.0	Syrik_Zero	Too many fixable annoyances	Ads need to follow the sound options I have selected. Sound & music sliders are all the way down. The sound/music checkbox is turned off. My phone is in silent mode. Still ads will blast sound through my speakers. So frustrating.

My kid enjoyed the game for 3 hours then he clicked to buy gems with real money and it let him without prompting for a password! My kid is 6 all the controls for password purchase are on. His other apps don’t let him just buy things without a password prompt with stops him. It let him spend $150 with out password consent. Which over-road all the apple settings. Now apple is giving me a hard time refunding my money.

US	5	2020-06-11	5.3.0	reddogxxxxxjjjjjtoto	This is the best game	DragonML is the best. I love the Dragons, there soooo cute, and it has good qualities but I do wish that people would not have to pay to get more gems I would rather pay a million coins for 10,000 gems but that’s over but that would be the BEST OFFER EVER!!!!! But I understand, because that’s how they make money. But best game ever. Love it. Everybody should play it.
US	5	2020-06-11	5.3.0	BDB1980	Review	Love the game but I think think the wait times for everything is a little to long.
US	3	2020-06-11	5.3.0	Hugehpfan	Fun, but...	I love the premise of this game. I like that there are basically several games in one. I like the challenges, but I have NEVER been able to breed the dragon of the week despite breeding multiple times. I have NEVER gotten the dungeon dragon despite spending actual money to open the final chest multiple times. It gets frustrating after a while. Aside from that, I love this game. The first things I mentioned keep me coming back, but the latter keep me from ever spending actual money again. There is really little reward for doing so.
US	3	2020-06-11	5.3.0	Bts dancer	Money money money!	Ok first of this game is so fun to play I love collecting dragons, breeding them, and hatching them. There is a big problem though,    Mostly everything cost money 💴. I spend about maybe $5/$10 but like you probably have heard this before but the gems and dragon token OMG! There so high of prices and the videos only get you one gem I feel like the videos should at least give five or six gems and if you want to buy them they cost like $50 DOLLARS! When I could get the eel dragon I thought it wasn’t so pricey I mean 200 gems are you insane! And for one dragon token 25 gems! I’m sorry if I sound rude/picky. So this is why I’m only given three ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ so if you want a five ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ rating I suggest you fix these things. That’s all from me bye now 😊😊😊

First off I wanna be able to log out and switch accounts because I played on my iPad and I got really far. Then I started on my phone and I am really bad. Second and last is being able to battle against friends. The reason I say that is that the only thing you could do with friends is end gifts, and help with your island.

US	4	2020-06-09	5.2.2	holoholoholo	A few problems	My cousin introduced me to this game a few weeks ago and I pretty much my opinion now. First when you breed a dragon it costs an insane amount of gems to speed it up. Second I saw a thing where if I connect my Facebook I can get 10 gems and a dragon. But then I tried it and it’s taking forever to do the process I haven’t been able to connect my Facebook with the app. Those were my only problems but other than that the game is pretty fun -meepmoop
US	5	2020-06-09	5.2.2	uhh download this	It’s nice	DragonML is a good game if you like dragons and if you ever had dragon city you know what this game is but DragonML is better. I know I sound like I am getting forced but I am not. Cause I am  young

I feel as though we should be able to trade, sell, or give dragon and other things possible to other player. There are some dragon in the game that I am not fond of, have duplicates of, or just don’t like, but others might want or need them. I hope you take a minute to review my suggestions.

Also it is fun to do battle to win stuff and to beat other people. I would totally recommend this game. But I would love to add some features like would if you could have your dragons involve to more advance dragons as you go higher in the raking. The dragons should have different features like how they can use their powers to go against people in the battles and to have stronger powers once they get older. And maybe you should add riddles to solve every day a new riddle to finding new dragons. Last but not least you should add new dragons and once they get older you should add new powers to them. Thank you so very much for this game I love it and it is so very cool. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love this game so muchhhhhhhh

Just like how we can configure gems into gold.. 
otherwise this game is incredible

US	2	2020-06-03	5.2.2	WoF Hybrid Kat🦜	Good Idea, horrible execution.	"I ❤️ DML! My brother and I are OBSESSED :) but a few major problems force me to write this review. 
1) V.I.P. I think VIP is a bad idea. The only reason is because I want to try and unlock every dragon, but VIP has to be AT. LEAST. Level 14!!! (Quadwing Dragon?) this is outrageous. All the other vip perks are reasonable. (Less wait, more rewards, etc.) please fix this.
2) GEMS ARE IMPOSSIBLE! Gems in this game are next to impossible to get. And you want me to spend 600 on some freaking' LEGENDARY!? Too much! I have 19 gems right now. I am a level 12. This is not fair. Make gems more obtainable, OR make gem things less expensive.
3 the worst one) WAIT TIMES, WAIT TIMES, WAIT TIMES!!! The wait times are so freaking INCOMPETENTLY LONG that we have to spend DAYS after playing to PLAY MORE! Ridiculous! I'm going to stop playing. The wait times are unreasonable. Shorten them down! I've played so many games with better wait times. I love this game. I don't want to write this review. You will never hear my voice and you will turn to the five star reviews from people who pay $100+ on this game. I am done. I am truly fed up with this PAY - TO - PLAY game. Good-bye."

US	4	2020-06-01	5.2.2	Mama Coey	It’s cute	"There’s a bit too many little things going on right away. It would be easier to learn if you just had one dragon for a couple days to feed, pet, and train. But it just uploads a lot of information upfront.
Still, it’s cute and mindless eventually. A good time filler."
US	3	2020-06-01	5.2.2	BuzzTap	Fine game.	I really enjoyed playing the game, but a lot of times there’s random black outs. But the game is really fun. I love the special events and and exploring every were I can, but the game keeps over welling me with things you have to buy with real money. But over all the game is really fun and I love collecting all the dragons and upgrading things. I love the idea of putting several dragons in one habitat and I love the mystical things in this game. I like all the different dragons and fighting on the campaign map. Thank you so much for every thing.

US	1	2020-05-30	5.2.2	theFNaF fanofscottcawthon	A horrible version of Dragon City	This is just Gameloft’s failed attempt to make something like SocialPoint’s very amazing Dragon City. The dragons are lame, only a handful of them are cool, It’s combat system is trash, It’s offers are trash, Dragon City beats it at everything. It does NOT deserve it’s rating, it should be way lower. Gameloft, do better at your games

I’ve played no better mmo FPS than this. If you know of a better one Array,I’d like to know. Most weapons are not worth paying real money for and I think they need to let you try before you buy because they’re expensive (only possible if opponents drop) but only for short time. The only weapons worth paying real money for are (as of oct 2017), IMO, the shurikans, desert eagle, m200 sniper rifle. I’ve found none of the other weapons worth paying real money for.

I see that people are saying the game has a few bad things here and there, and I see where they are coming from but at the same time this game is an absolute delight. It’s really fun to play and entertaining ( at least for me it is ). I really would recommend it and it’s just cool to see every time when u get a new dragon that u don’t have. It’s really cool and fun sure it can have it’s bad things here and there but besides those little things it’s a really fun game. And again I would recommend this game.❤️

US	5	2020-05-26	5.2.2	jdp3254	Dragon mania suggestion and review	Firs this game is amazing and second it’s amazing. But I have a suggestion right now the game is doing movie genres and son I’m wondering if it could be Greek gods like Zeus and posiodon. But over all the reason I like this game is cause you collect dragons and breed them to get more and then you can fight other dragons with your dragons.

The only down fall is that the wait for everything to be up graded, but overall it’s real good game and it’s quite easy to get gems! In some games it’s really hard to get gems, but in this game you just do a quest! It’s that easy! And it like six games in one! It’s incredible!

US	5	2020-05-22	5.2.2	axolotl.loves.music	Love this game!	I first got this game years ago, and so recently re-downloaded it to see great progress! I really never get bored playing it, which is great because I usually tire of most games within a few weeks of playing. It’s just the right balance of complexity and simplicity. My one complaint, and it’s more of a nuisance than a problem, is that it takes so many materials to enchant dragons. After each enchantment it gets more difficult and takes longer to acquire the required quantity and quality of enchantment materials, and although I understand the progressing difficulty, it’s just a pain. Overall though, great game!

US	4	2020-05-21	5.2.2	Crystalgem09	Events	"There is so much to do in this game. There is an arena, campaign map, and special events that offer certain dragons as rewards. The events can be pretty hard and in tournament events, the winner pays normally. However in most solo events I win.

That’s about all I have to say."

US	4	2020-05-20	5.2.2	LaffyTaffy2020	AMAZING, yet a little bit flawed.	I love the game in itself, with the dragons, and the quests, and the exciting new events. Yet I feel as if the designs are a little repeated. For example, the Agent Dragon looks cool on its own, but compared to the Boiling Dragon, these aren’t so different. And even then, those designs look like a Water design, with the flippers and whatnot. But the Agent Dragon isn’t even water! Not to mention the EIGHT other dragons with this base design. If I could post images in these reviews, I would draw some replacement designs for a few of the dragons.

US	5	2020-05-16	5.2.2	Abr gamer	Great Game!	I've had so much fun with this app and have been in love with it. It's a great idea, great gameplay, And so much fun. It's so good! I love being able to breed and raise dragons, battling, and doing arena tournaments. What little adds there are is amazing . I've played this game for around three years, and its remained one of my all time favorites . I download it on all my mobile devices, and absolutely love it.  I don't have the VIP membership, but I do like the one and a while milestone VIP day tickets. One thing that I would change is purchasing gems increasing VIP level. It's extremely expensive to be purchasing gems back and forth, that you might not use. I think something else that would work out would be the rarer dragons you breed and the more rare dragons you breed would increase the VIP levels. The gems are expensive, but besides that, the app is amazing. I don't personally worry about the VIP situation , I just think it would be a good suggestion. Thank you for this amazing game!
US	3	2020-05-16	5.2.2	Layla💕❤️	DML	It’s a really amazing game they didn’t sponsor me or tell me to write this FYI but it’s just an amazing game but there is something to watch out for. If you link it to your Facebook it MIGHT make you loose all progress this has happened to my sister and multiple other people so yeah that’s the thing too worry about other than that it’s cool to unlock new dragons and compete w your friends and just it’s a fun game I really recommend it!!!

US	5	2020-05-15	5.2.2	ABVA2011	Awesome game	DML/dragon mania legends is an awesome game i love playing it it’s really fun but something happened and I had to start over but at the time I right this it’s 5/15/2020 and I’m level 26.So what happened was I played on my dad’s phone and got to level 45 and my brother played on his Apple iPad mini.I wanted to play on an iPad because I liked to play all day but my dad had to use is phone a lot.So I wanted my own iPad and my brother’s iPad mini ended up breaking.So my dad ordered 2 of the newest iPads and 2 really good cases I wanted the rose gold iPad and my brother wanted the silver iPad and I picked out a cases with like an ocean looking cases and my brother picked a plan dark red color.So this is were the bad thing happened so my dad tried to transfer my games on  his phone to my iPad but instead they got delete so I had to start over and I don’t blame DML it was a mistake.Over all DML is a great game.😍👍❤️❤️💜💜🧡🧡🖤🖤💛💛🤍🤍💚💚🤎🤎💙💙❣️💕💓💞💗💝💘💖

US	5	2020-05-14	5.2.2	BlutigeEngel55	Larger name character limit	The current character limit for a dragon name is too short, if you could extend it to ten letters, that would be great!

US	4	2020-05-14	5.2.2	Kitten BT	Overall, great fun	Fun game if you like dragons and collecting/raising teams, sort of like Pokémon. Fighting is a bit limited but fun. Events seem very skewed towards pay to play, but you can still progress in the game without paying money, you just can’t win/achieve everything that they can. Sometimes a bit buggy, but impressively stable overall for the amount of data a personal account manages.

US	4	2020-05-13	5.2.2	Ambaa2891	Mysterious 🐉 dragon	I love this game it is so epic and you can breed lots of different dragons and you can level up and get all new dragons and feed them all and level them up you can also do games against Vikings and win dragons you can train your dragons to help them win battles and stronger dragons can win easily and ther is nothing bad and I love the game and that’s all I can say
US	4	2020-05-13	5.2.2	KarenIsMyMom	Needs more things to do	It’s a great app with awesome graphics, but is all around kind of lacking in content. The portal is a great thing to do while you are waiting for an egg to hatch or anything to finish, but that gets a bit old after a while. My suggestion is to maybe add a flying mini game where the player controls the dragon as they swerve and dodge obstacles like rocks or even other dragons. I personally would really enjoy that. Also maybe cut down the wait time for eggs and breeding. I have an egg that has taken 31 hours just to hatch, if I’m including the breeding process. I really don’t have any more complaints and it is an overall very fun game.

US	1	2020-05-12	5.2.2	CJ4545454545	Unskippable ads that pop up unprompted??	I really liked this game. It was like any other game, you could choose to watch ads to earn in game items. But now in the last few days, there are unskippable ads that pop up unprompted! Now every couple of minutes you have to watch a 30 second ad for the privilege to keep playing! It made it completely unplayable and I hate it now. Whoever thought that was a good idea needs to do some serious reconsidering.

US	5	2020-05-12	5.2.2	WolfieTheAlphaOfGacha	game of patience	"This is a fun game where you can battle dragons and hatch as many as the game allows! There are endless choices of dragons to specialize in. 🔥💧⭐️🌙☀️⚡️🍌🍇🥑🍪(the fruits are the food dragons) BUT this is a game of patience. Sometimes it’s not that bad like waiting 30 min for sourcone or waiting a minute for your dragon to come back from the academy. Some thins take a long time like buying the max food in your farm or hatching a really rare dragon and I’m ok with that. Some people might not so maybe shorten some wait times?                                                   Also in the dungeon I think it would be really cool to fight other players’s dragons instead of the one that is almost impossible to beat. You could also battle against other clans dragons if your in a clan. This would be an amazing feature to your already amazing game!!!!

(P.s sorry I’m sending so many of these it’s just that mine are always at the bottom or hard to find)"

US	4	2020-05-11	5.2.0	Kirsten3472justinbieberrocks	Amazing game but I deserve a refund	I am taking one star off cuz I was going to awaken an element for my divine dragon and I wanted to see what level was required so I clicked awaken element and accidentally bought it for gems cuz I HAD 175 GEMS AND IT WONT GIVE ME A REFUND AND I HAVE NOT EVEN USED THE VOID ELEMENT YET CUZ I HAVE DIVINE
US	2	2020-05-11	5.2.0	By etsang	I Used to Love It.	"The game was extremely addictive, the reason is because it’s not just a normal idle game where you wait for dragons to hatch, but you can battle in so many places to keep you occupied. The new update did NOT change any of those things, but did change the graphics in such a strange way. The weird designs were to distracting when I am battling, and it seems so much more complex then it has to be. Not only that, but it seems a bit to fast moving and confusing. I wish there was a settings button that could change it for people who prefer the original way better. 
Challenges: For the challenges, yes, they seem hard enough for some users, but for others it’s extremely hard (lvl 1-30). Challenges that are a bit easier and can fit the person’s level would be more fitting, but the prizes should be lesser. That being said, examples would be: Level 35 or higher could breed for Part Plant, Void, and wind (or something along the lines of that.) 
Clans: With clans, it’s very hard to communicate other then requesting material. I do understand why some chats are restricted though, mostly because of personal ID giveaways(phone number, town, name, etc.) but with a clan there are some people who can say if it’s to personal or not. Further more, the clan leader can kick the person out. 
Gifting: When gifting a friend, you have no idea what you are going to give. If you can give a certain amount of money, diamonds, dragon cards, or even a dragon, you could help your friends buy something or battle a dragon. 

These are just suggestions of course, and if you took time in reading this, thank you!"

US	5	2020-05-11	5.2.0	jsjdjsmfnSkdjdn	Genders, Great Game!!	I REALLY like this game!! But I wanted to try out genders... I wanted to see if genders for the dragons would work out like when you buy the egg you can pick the gender or when you breed them the gender is at random... but this will most likely never happen because it’s a bit more fun just randomly breeding them or if you have a ship... just saying, but this is just my opinion otherwise AMAZING game!!!!

After I go to the dungeon and start my battle, it always says reconnecting at some point and kicks me out of the battle, making me lose all my stepping stones, which I do not appreciate. Just wanted to say something so maybe the game can be fixed.

There was just one thing that i thought could be better, Hatching. I think hatching time and everything is fair of course but when I get an egg that I don’t want I have to wait a few hours to sell it and it takes up room in my hatchery. Thank you so much I love this game. Sincerely, mallorylovescats.

US	5	2020-05-02	5.2.0	KatGamer5439	The fun never stops! ❤️	Raise baby dragons, feed them, teach them, and train one dragon to be your champion. I love this unique and carefully crafted game. The game never stops, wether your fighting in the arena, collecting Crops, collecting coins, leveling up dragons and habitats, or sending your dragon to the academy; there’s always something to do. If you aren’t a patient person I do recommend investing a little bit of real money into the game, but if you don’t mind small waits here and there then this is a game that can totally be played completely free. Now like I said I am definitely hooked on DML. Just an idea though: what if we added more to hands on training our precious little dragons. I like the viking target practice, but what about maybe some sort of flight training, or for water dragons diving/swimming. Maybe some sort of speed training to have a more hands on experience with the dragons themselves. Also having a way to produce more dragon food would be helpful, leveling up dragons it difficult and costly in food and coins. I absolutely adore this game though and can’t wait to see future updates and events, Thank you for all the time spent improving the users experience! Keep up the great work! ❤️😊💎

US	4	2020-04-30	5.2.0	Thankubutnext	Overall great but the events	You guys should make the events so like only the people with the same level are competing each other i don’t think it’s for like a level one to go against a level 95 in an event. Because they may not have the resources that the higher level has and it’s not fair fix that and it’ll be 5 stars

US	5	2020-04-30		best game developers	Thank you	So I played this like 4 years ago and my family played also and I got a new iPad and forgot to get the game back and 4 years later I remembered it and got it back and I’m really happy and it’s a really good game it excites people and it’s like a journey but a digital one
US	5	2020-04-29	5.2.0	Charmi646	It is the best game ever	THE BEST GAME EVER
US	3	2020-04-29	5.2.0	Superman77!!!	Can’t start or join a clan.  🙁	The game says you can start a clan in this country.
US	5	2020-04-29	5.2.0	ellacook_34	I love it	I play it all the time!
US	5	2020-04-29	5.2.0	JJKK6306	Good	It’s a really cool game how they come up with dragons l think that’s  creative because dragons aren’t real
US	5	2020-04-29	5.2.0	Chunglove	To good to awesome!	"This game always make me dream about this game whenever I feel like it. It is so awesome! And when I get new monsters, I sing happy songs, and I tell my parents what I got. But they always just say, ok, its cool. It’s not much when they say that, but I’m really amazed by them. Get Mainia legends! It’s so cool, you can really buy everything in this game.
But, I just started two days ago. But I love my monsters! I wish I could have all the monsters to myself. But, you guys will have good monsters too! You will get the best ones, only if you buy this game. So buy this game right now! Just do it! Or else I will warn you!"
US	4	2020-04-29	5.2.0	krjsjfkdjzfj	Fun & Perfect for boredom	On the other hand if you are in a brawl and your dragon is defeated you lose ur turn even if it was yours next, but yet of the opponents dragon dies the still get their turn which in my opinion isn’t fair. Also if u purchase the 30 day gem generators log in FAITHFULLY or you won’t get your money’s worth and lose the gems for the days lost! Other than that I love this game it allows you to earn VIP and gems without purchasing them!
US	5	2020-04-29	5.2.0	JW Fortnitegaming	Things I don’t like in the new update	I like the game but it’s the new update when I battle I can’t see my turn or the opponents and I don’t like how you made the new avatar I don’t like the new battles.
US	5	2020-04-29	5.2.0	DML gamer	Best game ever	It’s an amazing game it’s so addicting. My favorite app used to be YouTube but dragon mania legends changed it its the best game ever I’m on it almost 24/7 day and night I can’t get of it.
US	5	2020-04-29	5.2.0	dragonmaster0423	Great, but I have a problem with the new update	Whenever I try to go into the app after the Nordic update, it shows me the blue game loft screen and then goes out of the app. It won’t load.
US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	Billie marsh	Yasss!	This is the best game ever to play with friends ! It keeps me intertained for hours!!!!!!
US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	TophRocke	Friend	I love the game it's really fun but could you guys I don't know but if he has just lower prices it's really expensive to do a lot of the things that I really want to do like how am I going to get 39,000 a day yeah yeah I know that this stuff a transform the more that we spend on the game transform into Real life but do you spell expensive and I also have a question how do you become friends with like another player how do you like get to become friends with another player how do you like to be back soon love Shiloh aka your biggest fan
US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	poofey_	Nice!	I love this game! It is really fun to play and I love to see all the different dragons you can breed! I have had no major problems with this game! The only complaint that I would have (which this is just for me) but I knew that after a recent competition, I was going to get my first legendary dragon! I updated the game and got on, but upon opening the app, there was nothing! No prizes, no extra food, no extra coins, and no legendary dragon! I saved up food, I built a legendary temple, and I built a legendary habitat, but alas, it all went to waste because there was no legendary Pixie Dot dragon at all. I don’t know if this was just for me, but if you are reading this and currently own the game, I would recommend logging in to claim your prizes first then right afterwards going to update this app. I think I’m just a little bummed out, but of course, this is not the end of the world. I still would recommend playing this game because it still has brought me a lot of entertainment!
US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	da damage dan	Great game	Dis dame dis dery doog dis dame dis Dalso dun
US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	GunGamerSoldier	Awesome!	I love this game so fun! But the dragons are very cute. Every time it says “enjoying dragon mania?” I am not looking and I press “no” and it makes me sad cause I love this game.
US	4	2020-04-28	5.2.0	lggughgcghgvkcdjdivhu	Make it easier to get gems	I love this game, but you have to pay money to get gems if you ask me that’s not fair.but besides that it’s a great game.

US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	gamer2-386986	Problem with saving	Hi, I once was super strong on this game but it got accidentally deleted! I lost everything!  I hope you guys can fix that..... not me the saving issues! Fix it like save progress that way if someone loses the game they still have there progress. Thanks for reading! ( be sure to read and fix other comments to please) stay healthy 😷🤧🤗
US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	Unicorns_forlife	Very good game	I like the game but the deals are a bit pricy even though they are on sale, but overall, I would definitely suggest this!!!!
US	4	2020-04-28	5.2.0	LtDrMom	Pretty great	This game is really fun and not really hard but there are some points that feel like pay to win I have not payed and I have almost every dragon but sometimes it feel like pay to win
US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	jade 🌞	Amazing, multilevel game!	"I had DML a while ago and I recently got it again. This game has so many different layers and things to do. It’s almost like living a life there! You can breed dragons, feed them to get them to higher levels, and battle with them. And there are so many places to battle as well! The league, arena, and campaign map are just a few but there’s even more! I’ve heard a lot of people complain about it being too money dependent but I don’t really agree. You don’t necessarily HAVE to speed up a breeding or hatching an egg. This game requires you to be patient and if you are there is a great payoff. Sure, gems are hard to get, but you don’t REALLY need to buy tickets or dragons with gems. Although the dragons that are only purchasable with gems look really cool they aren’t necessary to play the game. Just make sure to save up your gems and complete quests and achievements and you’ll find yourself with a good amount of gems. And there are plenty of ways to get gems. For example, petting your dragons. I pet all my dragons at least once per day and I get around 2-4 gems a day. And Have around 30-40 dragons. It’s easy. Also if you go to your quests you may find some good ways to get gems. 

DML is also big on strategy. While getting food may take a long time, a more efficient thing to do would be to upgrade your farms so they can produce more food. So in this game, if you don’t want to spend money, be patient and play with your brain! Think through every decision, and make sure to have fun! 😎

ALSO THE DRAGON BABIES ARE SO CUTE OMG 😍"
US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	independix	my favorite game	Dml is an overall amazing game to play from arena battle to campaign to all the amazing dragons best in my opinion. Keep up the good work! <3
US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	Glitzyangel1	Amazing	"Okay, this is an amazing game, I have been playing this since I was six BTW I am only 9 years old.

I LOVE IT!!!"
US	2	2020-04-28	5.2.0	jorden5.89	My review	I think the eggs should not take that long to hatch same to breed the gragons it is a very long intemidating wait so will u shorten them before I freak out
US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	owlhooman44	Amazing	I love this game is much, there is so much to do with it and is really addicting
US	5	2020-04-28	5.2.0	1@1@中国话	Great, but I have a suggestion	It’s all great and everything, but can we have more time for the boss challenges and getting divine/legendary/ancient dragons easier?
US	3	2020-04-28	5.2.0	def14609	Update issue	Just downloaded the recent update and now the the daily rewards video is not working... plays the video for the full time but then the chest/card pack is not rewarded.
US	4	2020-04-27	5.1.1	beMarie04	It’s good	This game is good, but after it updates it glitches. Take today for example, it updated and I had just placed 1st in one of the challenges and I was supposed to win a new dragon. However I opened the app and it never gave me my prize. I love this game soo much though and can’t stop playing it. Things like that just make it harder to participate in challenges and promotions.
US	5	2020-04-27	5.1.1	Gamefoodie	It	I am very sad you can’t sync progress without Facebook
US	5	2020-04-27	5.1.1	Jesus is Mind Renewal	I love it	I love it
US	3	2020-04-27	5.1.1	WorkingMama1881	Fun game	I love this game but have a few complaints about it. First is how long it takes to plant, breed and hatch. Next is the that you have to wait to battle after three turns. Otherwise it is a great game to play!
US	3	2020-04-27	5.1.1	Tambean7321	Downloading	Don’t like downloading 2 and 3 times a day.The dungeon needs work,It doesn’t give enough tokens coins for stepping stone. It should last until you get the every treasure box.
US	5	2020-04-26	5.1.1	hahaaaaaa!!!!!!	Omg I love dragons so I love this game	It’s just like clash of clans!

US	5	2020-04-26	5.1.1	khahlaf	From ahmad	This game is the best game I’ve ever played in my entire life
US	5	2020-04-26	5.1.1	SnowCrystalMuffin	Very good❤️	It’s fun and good but it takes forever for a dragon to have a egg and for the egg to hatch. Other then that it’s very fun and awesome😃
US	4	2020-04-25	5.1.1	why is nickname taken2	Fun	It’s fun yep
US	3	2020-04-25	5.1.1	rs2loko	Everything is expensive	The game is all good and fun but the fact that literally almost everything is so expensive makes this game more stressful, if trees and all these flowers just lowered the price like I mean theres a flower that cost 8000 coins to destroy and a tree trunk for 30,000 which takes 20 minutes. Please lower the prices. Even food is expensive 15,000 for 1,500 food and these dragons be needing a lot of food! All I’m saying is lower the prices, don’t make stuff that shouldn’t be expensive as expensive as they are right now, make these dragons eat less because I get very stressed when I ran out of food and cant level up my dragons because they eat to much and the food is expensive which takes forever to grow! 12 hours for 1,500 what a waste of time to be honest why so much time? Please change the way this game works.
US	5	2020-04-25	5.1.1	bsnsbbdwnnd	New dragon	You should add a night and light fury dragon
US	5	2020-04-25	5.1.1	dragonsml	Awesome!	The game is good, but ( as many others have said ) its hard to get gems

The one thing I noticed is you can’t move your dragons around to a different habitat like you use to be able to do. Why is that?"
US	5	2020-04-22	5.1.1	orelloma	Hi	Hi
US	5	2020-04-21	5.1.1	#TiggerTheTiger	😮🤩😁😄	This game is so great! It’s so cool that I can’t even explain how good it is!!! [(HAHA!) I can’t believe that they made an automatic review!]
US	4	2020-04-21	5.1.1	jidavis22	corona review	i’m addicted to this game during quarantine but i’m really upset at the fact how much diamonds cost because i have spent a lot of time trying to get the meadow dragon and i still haven’t been able to get it and i would stay up all night playing if i could but even though i’m 16 my parents still put screen time limits on my phone 🙄 So i wish gems cost less to but bc then i would buy some, Also i think adding an update where if you have a dragon you can send it to your friend so they now have it and you don’t. Just saying my friend gets the same dragon twice a lot and i still don’t have it so sending each other dragons would be pretty cool
US	5	2020-04-21	5.1.1	I hate games sometimes	😍🥰😘😚🌈❤️🐇🐈🐱🐰	I always love a good dragon 🐉 game! DragonML is the best! But I can’t beat the melon 🍉 dragon 🐉.    😅😂🤣🙃🙂🤓🤗😹😻

US	2	2020-04-19		LORD LORDERSON	It’s good but...	It’s a really good game. I had it before but my mom had to get rid of it because I always ask her to get stuff and then finally I give up and try a new game called How To Train Your Dragon it’s a really fun game.
US	4	2020-04-18	5.1.1	steamyPasta369	Love it!!!!!!!	Great game! I’m addicted. One thing I wish the developers should fix is that it is so hard to get gems! Most of the cool things that make the game fun have to be bought with the gems. If you want a lot of gems, you have to buy them with real currency for very expensive!!! Otherwise it’s a great gam!!!! Would recommend!!!!
US	5	2020-04-18	5.1.1	.a,x.alñ	Osa	The best game ever
US	1	2020-04-17	5.1.1	sophkim	Boring. Seems perfect for a child.	This game gets boring over time. Uninstalled.
US	4	2020-04-17	5.1.1	JazzyMet	Game is overall not bad	Rlly I have  o admit the game is mad fun leveling collect and battling with ur dragons is fun and all tho the ads drive me nuts and plus sometimes u can’t see the ads COMING and at least make it a little easier to get gems it’s dumb dat we have to watch an ad just for one gem ONE GEM but the game is still fun
US	4	2020-04-17	5.1.1	tegoon	Best game ever	I love this game so much I really enjoy  breeding the dragons and my brother saw me play this game one time and now he’s  obsessed. The only problem is there’s a lot of adds
US	4	2020-04-17	5.1.1	snoball 111	It’s great but	I liked it better when the bottom less dungeon was easier but now they changed it and not in a good way it has got harder

US	5	2020-04-16	5.1.1	HollyCharczar	Great fun!	My husband and I played this game together last summer a lot while we each waited for school to start again, and now I would like to play it again on my own. He had started playing without me haha so now I’m playing it. Really excited to play it because my students took my time from fun games, but now I have way too much time. I feel this will be a wonderful way to spend my dead time! Also nice to get back to. ❤️ cute dragons, and I love that you can PET them!
US	3	2020-04-16	5.1.1	yeetes fetes	Decent	Other than the excessive asking for ads it’s great
US	4	2020-04-15	5.1.1	lex83629	I have a question	I want to know why it takes so long to breed and hatch. I love the game but I don’t play it much because it takes so long. And some people don’t have a lot of diamonds and some parents don’t let there kids buy stuff online.
US	3	2020-04-15	5.1.1	EndMyMiseryTheThird	Great until recent	I first downloaded this game almost 2 years ago. Back then- it was fun. I got addicted. I loved it. Then all the in game purchases happened. They ruined the game. What I’m trying to say is that you can’t get ANYWHERE in the game without spending over $200 a week. I’d never pay anymore than $5 for an in game purchase. And I don’t mean small things that are optional- No in order to get through this game successfully you HAVE to spend your money. Good luck.
US	5	2020-04-15	5.1.1	unicorn lover 333	I love hasbro	I love hasbro‘s Games and toys that he makes they’re so awesome I just want to give Hasbro big hug. But he’s not right  beside me though I just love hasbro’s games he has the best things in the world I love playing LPS because you get to choose your mascot and make a YouTube channel.P.S I’m your number one fan hasbro

US	4	2020-04-15	5.1.1	layla sparkle	OMG  best game ever but missing something😢	This is a great game I would recommend it to anyone who loves dragons or is looking for a great way to pass the time! But it would be nice if we didn’t have to wait to hatch the dragon eggs  and the concept is really cool 😎 I  remember when I downloaded it and thought really dragons but when I was playing it I was attached I couldn’t get off😛😎😜🤗🐉also you NEED TO STOP THE ADS  and NO more waiting for the eggs I hade to wait A DAY FOR ONE EGG TO HACH😔- Layla sparkle 🤩
US	3	2020-04-15	5.1.1	COco1412	Pay to play	"I love this game in theory. It is right up my alley. I like the different levels of game play, I love all the different dragons. I would play this game nonstop for hours and days if I could. The problem is you can’t. All the necessary resources to make forward movement in this game require either way too much time or way to much money or both. The resources such as gems, food, coins, enchantment materials, to name the biggest ones, come at way to steep a cost (whether it be time or money) and deliver very little in return. It is frustrating and infuriating. I started playing this game about a year and a half ago. Spent some money on it too. But the problem is the further you get in the game the more expensive it is to keep enjoying it. So I uninstalled it for a year. I re-downloaded it recently because my 5 yr old son loved it. I actually downloaded it for him on 1 device and then enjoyed it so much that I put it back on my another device and was able to download my original game that from a year ago to keep playing. After a week I am ready to give up on it again. I spent more money on it only to realize how little you actually get for your money. I can’t advance on the battle map cause my dragons aren’t strong enough. The enchantment league matches you with impossible opponents. I would have to spend hundreds of dollars or take many many months of just logging in for 10 minutes several times a day to grow food and refight old battles to get enough food to level up my dragons sufficiently to move forward a little. Then I would be stuck again.
Bottom line, this is a great game for anyone who has hundreds of dollars to throw away every week. 
They could make it at least more playable for the average guy by simply making food grow more quickly and cost significantly less coins. Otherwise, it’s just frustrating."
US	5	2020-04-14	5.1.1	KingVirgo3	Very Addictive !!!	I found myself ready to spend a bunch of money trying to hatch my dragons to see which one I’ll get. I like the fact that you get to name your dragons, but my true is I get to level them up and complete a quest
US	1	2020-04-14	5.1.1	hehe155	Great but one big problem	This app is amazing. It’s fun and VERY addictive but there’s a catch! I was playing this game on my windows laptop. And now I have switched to Apple. And just now learned I can’t recover my old account. This may not seem like a big deal but I spent a lot of money on the old account and I worked really hard on there so for it to be gone *poof* hurts. Dragon mania legends is a great game but they need to update it to where it can be multi platform and make it simple and easy to switch it on to different devices

My friend code is 482847!!! 🤗
US	3	2020-04-11	5.1.1	Erich in Shanghai	Mabye not...	I used to love game .Then one day I tried to get in the game I waited and waited for it to load . It said “Sorry we are currently trying to load as fast as possible.”I waited for more than 30 minutes and it would not load.Then months after I tried to get into the game . It said you cannot get into the game sorry once again I was really mad it would not work. I could not play the game again I would lose all my progress I was mad and also really sad.

I do not like the dungeon now.  I liked it much better the original way.  There needs to be a way to get more food. Most of my dragons take 2 m food to advance and it moves too slow with what there is now."
US	4	2020-04-08	5.1.1	ilpugsm2116	I’m sad	I played this game every single day but someone deleted my game and I did not login and and I was level 36the highest I have ever been and I had a lot of special dragons I can get back😢😥😓😭😢😭😢😭😢😭
US	2	2020-04-07	5.1.1	bendyboss	This game is AWSOME!	I love the game I just love the lore and story along with the artwork and design of the dragons I especially love the events to get dragons and gems all in all this game is really great and I really recommend it for people who love dragons
US	4	2020-04-07	5.1.1	Tessa kimball	Review by a teenager	This mobile app is pretty cool, you could get all kinds of dragons. The boss fights get pretty hard so you should level up you’re dragons
US	4	2020-04-06	5.1.1	cocococo ccccc. c	To expensive to much time	"This is a pretty good game it’s addictive but it’s to expensive when you want to hatch a dragon and if the space is taken you want to buy more space right but it cost 150 gems way to expensive and then I go to the shop 25$ for 10 gems 1200 gems for a hundred dollars and then when you put the egg in it’s place it takes so much time that I have to wait till tomorrow morning and then I say I will stay up but no I fall asleep and it only offers you 2 videos and then wait 15 hours that’s not fair but overall it’s a good game and please fix this if not there are going to be a lot of the same issues

US	4	2020-04-04	5.1.1	Amber McCommons-Shahid	To many Ads	I love this game. There’s just so MANY ads for you to buy stuff. Makes it hard to keep playing.
US	3	2020-04-04	5.1.1	8348228437842543	Too much stuff	I really like the game i have been playing for about a week now it’s it’s great but there is way to many things going on at one time way to many things that say “sale” or “boss battle” or “get gems now” but other then all the ads it’s really a good game

US	5	2020-04-02	5.1.1	Kyleewinski5507	Very fun!	this game is so much fun! very fun to play when your bored! the only thing i don’t like is the wait times for breeding but other than that it’s so much fun!
US	4	2020-04-01	5.1.1	sameueydx	Awesome!	The game is fantastic and very creative it is my favorite game!Although I did have a small problem with the eternal fruit tree . I downloaded it and the it got sold and I only got a few pieces of gold! This was only a small misunderstanding and I hope I get it back. Overall it is the best game and you should definitely download !
US	3	2020-04-01	5.1.1	5472529	Fun but...	This game is really fun and addicting but if the game devs were not so money hungry then it would be more playable I am only a level 12 and an egg is taking 26 hours to hatch, the less a game asks for money the more people will want to play it hence the huge increase in destiny 2 players since it became free. If the wait times, and need for gems were increased it would become much more fun to play and I would play WAY more often. And listen to the customers they know what they want and it will eventually bring new players.
US	5	2020-04-01	5.1.1	Hanako kasa	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT	I absolutely love it, it’s amazing how the dragons look and how the game is so together but I git dragon city and it wasn’t as exciting so I give this a five star :D
US	5	2020-04-01	5.1.1	walffle_playz-13	It’s great but..	When I first downloaded this app I was addicted to the cute dragons. But when I noticed is when all the islands are full you can’t have any more dragons. Maybe a secret realm, should be added or more islands added and elements? It’s just a suggestion but it would be a great thing to add in. And maybe you could add other things to use Chronos? Like he could be used in clan events. Or he can give you special gifts once in a while.
US	5	2020-03-31	5.1.1	shooby doo wa	Awesome dragon game	This game is the most funnest game I’ve ever played and I very much love dragons.games are so awesome am I right?
US	5	2020-03-30	5.1.1	Sara2403_cr	Me encanta	Me encanta el juego y son super bonitos lo dragones
US	4	2020-03-30	5.1.1	MegaKaiju	Great game but has many flaws	First of all this game is really great. This game allows people to be able to raise cute animals and fight evil to save the world. There is also a arena for fighting other people. We can even enchant our dragons to power them up even further. But that&#39;s where the fun ends. First of all it is sooooo hard to get gems without having to pay money. 200 gems to buy the Eternal Fruit Tree and then 120 to level it up to level 2? I don&#39;t think so. And then it only has a capacity of 40 something thousand at level 1. Whereas my dragon requires over 30 thousand of a fruit and it takes too much time to harvest the best level 3 farm fruit. This is probably more bs than fun. You need to do better than this cuz the effort u put into the game is not enough. Increase the food yield of both farms and the Eternal Fruit Tree, increase the gems in ur pack by 5x lower the cost of rare epic and legendary dragons hatching slots and the Eternal Fruit Tree. Then people will come back to play this game because right now the game lacks a lot of things that can be found in others.

US	5	2020-03-30	5.1.1	the great showman flower	Suggestions ♡	"So I love this game. I spend so much time on it. But there needs to be changes.
Habitats: when you place a dragon in it? Why can’t I move it to a different habitat or in my inventory?! Like fix this. I would play this 24/7 if you do that. Please change it.

Fairies: you have dragons. Maybe add a fairy, they fly

Well I suggest this app for everyone! ♡

US	4	2020-03-29	5.1.1	C.S.W#24	Great game,but...	Great game, however I have downloaded this game twice and both times it has glitched on me and right now  I can’t get on the game! Very frustrating😡! I don’t want to have to start this game all over again!
US	5	2020-03-29	5.1.1	DarkDragon.00	Dragon ML	You guys have the best Dagon game I had deleted the game because I had no diamonds and did not want to wait for things to finish there time I wanted them then and there. But when I got the game back which was two weeks ago I had all my dragons money and everything I had before. I now have 137 diamonds and a ton more dragons than I had two weeks ago I love that I did not lose any of my data. I went to get dragon city which is a game like your guy’s game but it was not the same you have more Interact-meant than any other game I have play and I thank you for that. Also when you start getting more dragons It can become addicting😂😂😬.
US	1	2020-03-29	5.1.1	Jerbearblob	Fun game but is very buggy and laggy	It’s a great game all around, however. I tried it on my computer and it keeps freezing, then sometimes it doesn’t even start at all. And when it erased all my data and all the hard work I put in, that was the final straw so I uninstalled it. Then when I tried it on my phone, it keeps shutting down and closing the app. The creators either better fix all these issues, or not expect anyone to play it because this is ridiculous.
US	5	2020-03-29	5.1.1	Landonm34	Great game	5 stars Great game but I keep losing my gems please fix that bug. Thank you!
US	4	2020-03-29	5.1.1	anadoglover18	It’s ok	I mean it’s a little boring and hard but for the most part it’s okay
US	5	2020-03-29	5.1.1	cokeREVIEWS	Amazing	This game is super fun! That’s what I want to say. It’s a game where you can breed, level dragons up, fight battles, etc. There are a few ads, but not many. Also, everything is free! You can pay though to get more gems and stuff like that. You can also get it’s merchandise, not for free but it’s from Amazon. The Clans are also very fun, with no personal information allowed in.Though, there’s some downsides.... Like I mentioned earlier, sometimes you pay for things you REALLY want. Then there’re ads. The ads aren’t terrible, they’re kid-friendly. I think that DML is a very fun game overall! That’s why I gave it 5 stars!
US	2	2020-03-28	5.1.1	Lexigirl719	Getting ripped off.	"Wow. They’re ripping us off on our coins.

I just noticed this.

I had 11.1M coins. In the dragon arena (the enchantment one), you can swap your opponent for $5000 coins. I swapped out the opponents twice and noticed my coins when down to 11.10M. Then I did it again, 2 swaps - 11.09. And again. 2 swaps - 11.08.

For 100,000 coins, I should get TWENTY swaps. 

WHAT THE HELL! How rude."
US	4	2020-03-28	5.1.1	actyirtuifjyrxiyrdiryd	A complain for the breeding place	Ok first the breeding place is cool but when it is done why doesn’t it say would you store your egg or hatch? So yeah :\ I like the fireball dragon it’s cool (to the creators) what is your favorite dragon?

It takes 2 days and 9 hours to hatch a legendary I would like for it to be shorter or to speed it up with gems to be less especially if you payed for it it should just be able to place on top if your reading this DML I would like a divine or ancient dragon that’s all I ever wanted and I already spent money on the game so I’m not gonna quit

If you download this game you’re downloading DragonCity except copyrighted. If you do, I hope you like it. I didn’t.This is a bad game. That’s what I think

US	5	2020-03-23	5.1.1	Giulio Fassina Ruiz	Lo que pienso sobre Dragón Manía	Este juego a mejorado muchísimo desde la ultima vez que lo vi me recuerdo que cuando era mas pequeño eran como caricaturas y este juego me encanta porque es de dragones y ciencia ficción sobre ellos y con otras persona y demás los gráficos también lo único que digo es que a mejorado muchísimo y ahora estoy súper contento con este juego y me va bien en el en la liga bronce tres estoy de número nueve

US	5	2020-03-22	5.1.1	rattle the snake	Love the game! But there is one problem.	Amazing game, but due to this Coronavirus, people are not playing this game that much so it would be fair if we get 300 ancient pieces for each ancient dragon in the this event for the reward when the dragon dice event is almost over. Or it would be fair if we could pick the 300 ancient pieces of the ancient dragon that each of us choose so we all have a choice and not just one way, it would motivate all of us to play this game and it would make a lot of people very happy!
US	5	2020-03-22	5.1.1	Pujlum	Thank you!	Thank you for making this app! I love the dust dragon you the best!!!!!!!!
US	5	2020-03-22	5.1.1	cantplayish	Can’t change language	First I was playing the game in Chinese then I didn’t know how to turn it into English
US	5	2020-03-22	5.1.1	gfakkjtezvjkfayib	L❤️ve it!!	This game is so much fun and addicting. My kids love it so much I made them one. I even convinced my husband to recently start playing. This a bit of every game I’ve played put into one. Battles, breeding cute dragons, land expansion. Always something to do. It’s a challenge once you get so far. And it expands in many ways. Wether you want to simply breed and collect dragons or be a battle champ it’s fun. Most games you need to pay to get truly where you want. You can buy but you can also get there with dedication. Thank you for a fun game! I’m invested.

I love this app for a lot of reasons one of them is cause I love dragons and they’re so cute the nest reason is cause they are so cute as baby’s.In the game there’s never a glitch and when there is that’s only like once a month or two.I feel like it’s the best game for people who like dragons,simulator games,and having war.I don’t care if you disagree with me it’s just my opinion.Thats why I think it’s the best app ever!

US	3	2020-03-19	5.1.1	DML maniac	Love it but some problems	This game is really fun and I recommend it. I have a ton of dragons and they’re really fun! But there’s one problem that you have to buy gems with actual money but gems are useful for speeding up everything so I now have to go to the lottery wheel but even that is a 30% chance of a gem. I know that sounds like a lot but realistically it’s not. There is also a rule that dragon names can be only 6 characters. That’s really unfair.

US	5	2020-03-16	5.1.1	Terrahess	Great game, go and buy it!	I think it’s a good game with all the battling  and breeding other animals. It’s cool that when you get another egg type when it’s done being bred. I would get it!
US	4	2020-03-16	5.1.1	Mae Whited	Moving dragons.	This is a great game, very addictive, I see the hype. The only real issue I have with the game is that you can’t move dragons to a different habitat if they are level 13+ I believe, which I highly dislike, it’s a real inconvenience to not be able to organize all of my dragons, not sure if this will do anything but that’s it, otherwise great game.

US	5	2020-03-14	5.1.1	Somephone12345	This game is sooo awesome! ❤️❤️❤️	I TOTALY recommend this game! The dragons are super cool, and I love how you can unlock dragon islands. The picture quality is really good, and I like the different varieties of awesome dragons you can get. There is barely any adds, which is super good. But I do find it difficult when you are trying to unlock things with gems. The gems are hard to get, unless you buy them with real money. It took me FOREVER to upgrade the hatchery with gems that I was earning in the game. Also, the wait time for things is sometimes a little too long. I don’t think that anyone really wants to wait 24 hours for a baby dragon egg to hatch, or unlocking a legendary dragon’s power, even if you don’t mind waiting. Overall, this game is sooo amazing! If you want a cool dragon game, this is perfect for you!

US	2	2020-03-07	5.1.1	Here in houston	Expensive if you want to enjoy	I loved this game early on. There is so much to do and I loved breeding the dragons to get different combinations and such. But it quickly got to a point where you had to purchase things to be fun. Now don’t get me wrong, I spend money on games all the time. I’m not someone who wants all the games to be free. I get they cost money to make. But the items in this game are hellaciously over priced. $25 in real money gets you basically nothing in the game. I have other games where I can spend $5 here and there and get moderate amounts, so I find myself spending a lot more money there over time. On this game I don’t feel like I’m getting enough to make my money worthwhile, so I don’t spend any. I think the makers would find people spend more money over time if they feel like they are getting their money’s worth, so to speak.
US	5	2020-03-06	5.1.1	Meat+heat=meatcandy	Really good game	I think it’s amazing and that you should get it.Theres one problem there’s so many ads and besides that it’s perfect!
US	5	2020-03-06	5.1.1	damon of paris	Updates	Dragon mania legends i got to thank you for updates.They improve this game and makes it better and fun to play.Lots of people like this game and we need this game to take a break from our everyday life stress and drama were all dealing with so thank you very much everyone which created and developed this game up-to this day.Thank you very much.
US	1	2020-03-06	5.1.1	Zzjump	Real Info	"When I first started playing this game I was very happy with it, however, after a while, I had to write down ""real info"" like phone number, national id, real name, etc. I really wish that I could play and have privacy."
US	4	2020-03-06	5.1.1	Deadly flamingo	Hi	I played this game when I was 8 and just found it again it’s a great game
US	4	2020-03-05	5.1.1	Addictive game....	Great game	It’s a great, fun game. And a ton of dragons to choose from. One thing- would be nice not to have to wait 12 or more hours for food to be available. I understand that you have to buy some things to give credit to the creators of the game. But it’s almost too long of a wait. I might delete and find another that you can progress a bit faster. Once your dragons reach level 11 - it takes way too long to up their level due to wait time of food.
US	1	2020-03-05	5.1.1	babyface1:)	Bad review	Cuts off every time I try to play it
US	5	2020-03-05	5.1.1	Tanden08	please help	Can you please give me some stuff I’m tired of having to spend money I will give you five stars but I want do you here this and help or else this will be a  One star
US	5	2020-03-05	5.1.1	stop_you_haters	Great game!!	I’ve scrolled through the reviews, and a lot of people are complaining about gems. Yes, they’re expensive, but they only speed the game along. I’d like to point out that games like require patience, and if you’re not willing to wait, then yes, I see where gems come in. However— this game is completely playable without spending money. You only have to spend money to either buy cool-looking dragons (which are awesome by the way), or to speed it along {as mentioned above}. Another important point is: the creators of the game aren’t just spending time and hard work on this (thank you for that), they’re also spending money to make this happen. One of the biggest reasons it’s so expensive for dragons, gems, tickets, etc., is because that money helps to cover the expenses to keep the game running (I apologize if this last point is proven wrong creditably, as this is only a estimate to the truth).
US	5	2020-03-04	5.1.1	Spartankid3000	Loving it	So the game is great and all pet maybe the gems can be. A little easier to get but I am just saying
US	5	2020-03-04	5.1.1	Gta5moblile	wow epic dragon game	"I love playing this game, it is so fun and addictive, and it has something for everyone.
My favorite things about it are that you can build your own island, and place things wherever you want instead of having some NPC say, “place this here” so that your island can have a personal feel, also that you can sort of create personal dragons through breeding, by spam breeding until you get a cool enough dragon, and if there is a dragon you don’t like or want, you can sell it instead of having to keep it, instead of some games where they force you to keep everything you buy or make, and that you can spend your in game money on anything in the game as long as you have enough, and there is no “you have to unlock this first” kind of thing except for the islands, but that kind of thing is understandable because it would be weird if someone had the final island but also didn’t even have the second one. It’s also pretty easy to get in game coins early on in the game by participating in online events, because completing challenges online gives a lot of money, but there is a lot you can spend the money on, so you have to make careful decisions. The last thing I like is that the tutorial isn’t long at all, it shows you what you need to know and you’re done, ready to do and build whatever you want. My only complaint is that you need lots of gems for lots of things, and unless you want to wait 13 hours for dragon breeding, you’re gunna have to use gems, and the only way to get significant amounts of them is by paying. Overall though, I think It is the best dragon game on the App Store and one of my top three favorite mobile games. Good job Gameloft!"
US	5	2020-03-04	5.1.1	WEBZ JoNeS	I love this game, but there’s just two problems.	I’ve played this game for three years, and I’ve got all the updates, but for starters: IT IS SOOOOO HARD TO GET GEMS! I’ve played for three years! THREE YEARS! And the highest my gem amount has been is 200! Secondly, whenever I log in, I can’t immediately go to the events! I’ll be waiting for ten precious minutes before they pop up! So, game loft, please make this better. I will then on be eternally grateful.
US	5	2020-03-04	5.1.1	Lexigirl719	Love the game. Hate the glitching. And the purchases.	"I love this game. I like how it’s loaded with mini games and challenges. So much to do.

However, it does glitch and run slow often. When that happens, I do notice an update comes out shortly after. 

I don’t like how we have to purchase extras of everything.  If that’s the case, if the cost was lower I’d def purchase. I don’t mind supporting the app, but I can’t spend $10 every week for a challenge. Those gems get spent fast. Maybe $2-$5 on some permanent upgrades gradually as the game progresses.  

Feeding the dragons is expensive and slows the progression as well. I’m trying not to get impatient of course, but just another note. 30k+ food for each feeding is insane to me.

Other than that, I love the game. I only mention these because I’d like to play more often without the limitation of very important features needed to continue."
US	4	2020-03-04	5.1.1	2113ah	Super fun!	I spend more time on this game than I maybe should.. the dragons look great, it moves fairly quickly, and there is a story (battles, quests etc.) to go along with building your world.
US	5	2020-03-03	5.1.1	:3 Its Gracie :3	DragonML is ePiC	DragonML is the best game ever! It’s so fun to play, and it can be a challenge too with the arena /battles. Ive been playing for maybe a while now or something but it’s the best! I’m not at a high level but I’m trying my best though. And I love being able to give things to a friend. I recommend it for anyone!

US	5	2020-02-29	5.1.0	Dragon Squad	Love the game but just have one problem	This game is amazing and all but the one thing I hate about it is that the brawl(aka when you fight dragon after dragon after dragon) you can’t use some of your best dragons because you need VIP level 8 or 11. I’m someone who doesn’t have VIP so that is really annoying because I have 10 dragons I can’t use. Other than that, this game is really fun and just to help anyone out who reads this: save up your gems to 150 to upgrade your hatchery so then you can hatch to eggs at one time. Trust me- this will make the game a whole lot easier
US	5	2020-02-29	5.1.0	3v33	Love this game! But the new update has some problems	I absolutely love all of the textures for the dragons and this game has me hooked. It’s a great way for me to connect with my younger siblings who love these types of games! But I have noticed a bug about the new tasks system, where some tasks say in text that they require X amount of that task, while the icon beside it says a completely different number! Just trying to help, I hope you guys patch this bug!

The dragon would have a fishing pole on its head like a deep sea anglerfish and it would also make a bioluminescence from the photophores on its body. I wouldn’t want the dragon to have white eyes and long sharp teeth. That would be creepy.

US	4	2020-02-04	5.0.6	Leader of Da winners	I Cant find a clan	"I hit the needed level to get into a clan like a year ago and I pressed quick join and it said they couldn’t find a clan for me then I sent a request and it’s been 2 months then I un sent the request and sent it to like one of the worst clans I could find and now it has been 7 months!!! That’s really annoying and the game keeps on saying to get a clan to do different things but my request has been pending for too long!!

Good game but Clans are really bugging me."

I love battling other kinds of dragons!!! There are so many different affects from your dragons powers! I think the dragon fury is the BEST! I LOVE THIS GAME!!!
US	5	2020-02-02	5.0.6	whittito	Cool 😎	It’s is cool 😎 and fun!!
US	4	2020-02-02	5.0.6	Khoa11	Pretty Good	When I played this game again after almost 4 years, I was addicted.The dragons and habitats look amazing. One problem though, it gets boring after a while. I rarely play it now. When I do play this game, I just try to collect the dragons. I was starting to get lazy doing the battles. I honestly think it’s not as good as Monster Legends or Dragon City.
US	5	2020-02-02	5.0.6	KEVIN.S.M	Best game	I used to play this game and I loved it back then and I love it now. Hey can’t remember not liking dragons .
US	4	2020-02-01	5.0.6	DML maniac	Love it!!😘😁	This game is really fun and I recommend it. I have a ton of dragons and they’re really fun! But there’s one problem that you have to buy gems with actual money but gems are useful for speeding up everything so I now have to go to the lottery wheel but even that is a 30% chance of a gem. I know that sounds like a lot but realistically it’s not. Besides that it’s a fun and exciting game.
US	5	2020-02-01	5.0.6	speedy ceeta	Dragons rock	I love this game so so much! Can you add more dragons to this amazing game? Maybe add a place so you can make your own dragon. Also can you make the gems cost less? Through all “DragonML” is my favorite game ever! Add more islands!
US	5	2020-01-31	5.0.6	Doodle sis	Play this game, it’s AMAZING! 😃 😊 😆	This is the best game of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020! You always start out by a ADORABLE baby fire dragon, then feed it fruit to grow it up, then you can fight with your powerful dragon! There are a bunch of things you can do with this app, like breed dragons to make hybrids, explore the ruins, fight on the campaign map, fight real people, and buy thousands of things with your coins, and much, MUCH more!! This is a fantastic app and thank you for reading! 🐉

US	5	2020-01-31	5.0.6	MegaKaiju	Really great game but i wish to convert resources	First off lets start with how great this game is. the arena, enchantment league, campaign, dungeon, and ruins make this game fantastic. i never run out of things to do on the game and the game helps me kill time when bored. also the special events that occur every now and then are fun and challenging in a good way. the collective leaderboard is a good way to compete with real players and earn rewards. I just wish for u guys to add in a conversion market. i should be able to gey rid of extra resources like scrolls. i want to be able to convert scrolls into food. 1 scroll would equal 2500 food and also gold into gems. 75000 gold would equal 1 gem. this way when i have extra gold and scrolls i don't need i can exchange them for more useful stuff. also the lvl 4 farm plants are wayyyyyyyyyy too expensives. decreasing the price by like 30% would be really great cuz it takes too long to gather up money and be able to farm the fruits for food so my dragons can level up.

US	5	2020-01-25	5.0.6	#oWl$@reawsOme	GR8 game small problem	So this is a great game and I LOVE it! for two weeks straight I played it almost nonstop! And almost every thing the the video says is true. But if you look at the top of the screen and to the left you will see purple gems. The video says that this person has twelve thousand and something gems. But I only have 58 I have had this for a year so don't think that you can get gems for free. If you want any you will have wasted $50 in about an hour. So get the game if you want it. But be careful with your money.

US	3	2020-01-21	5.0.6	TexasTexasTexasTexas	I’ve been playing for 3yrs and..	I’ve been playing this game for three years now, it really is a great fun game. BUT ever since they took the global chat out, the game has slowed down a lot. Hardly ever can find new clan members, can’t chat with other clans to get advice. Since about two months after that happened I’ve stopped playing daily, and so has everyone I know even in my clan. I love the game, but if they could bring that back I know a bunchhhh of us would make a huge comeback!
US	5	2020-01-20	5.0.6	mud pie the great	This is a game for dragon fans of how to train your dragon	This game is a legendary because if you finish a quest you get money berries and sometimes gems and when you breed I will tell you what dragon at the bottom of the screen and there are a lot of dragon you can collect like dragon city but my favorite dragon is salamander that’s what I call him and I love dragons so if you are a dragon fan get this game pick a gender and age then get started then it will help you what to do so that’s it and bye people hope you are reading this and good bye ❤️
US	5	2020-01-20	5.0.5	Demobip	I love it! But a small problem here please help..	I used to play this game a long time ago probably 4 years ago and I am so addicted into this game, there was is just one problem I’m having right now, the loading screen just glitches and closes the app, I’ve tried to go back on it many time and it keeps doing the same thing, could you explain why it’s doing that? I have good internet and I’m confused on why it keeps doing it..

US	5	2020-01-19	5.0.5	Afrixangreylover	Great game!	Great game but I have ine problem with it,and that’s that it calls some words abusive when they’re not abusive. I tried to name one of my dragons Spotty,and it said the name I selected contained abusive words. It was the same case with Spot. How are those words abusive?! Also one more thing. Please make an update that you can make your dragon names as long as you want. 6 letters is too little. I am a wings of fire fan and I’ve named some of my dragons after wof characters but there are some names I’d like to use but can’t such as Starflight and Kinkajou,and Anemone.(Those names are too long)

Please play this game for a awesome adventure with all these amazing creatures, and play with your best friends.🤩👍👍👍

Battling and defeating other dragons is so satisfying! The only thing I don’t like is the endless waiting hours for dragons to breed and hatch. But other than that    I.   love.   this.  game!!!!
US	5	2020-01-13	5.0.5	I am not a girly girl	feedback	This app is fun and quite addictive.But after a while I got bored of being broke so I got 300 gems for 10 bucks.i used this to get about 4000 stepping stones.I got to the chest and opened it once I was expecting to have at least a little gems left after,I only had 28.I was disappointed and felt ripped off when I found out I had to this 14 more times.And if my math is correct,using your “best deal” package would use about 14,000$.On a mobile game?That should have costed 1.00$ and for a dragon that only has light attack as a element I could not breed or buy at the time.Awful prices and ads are every 5 seconds it seems.Atleast no ads in battles...
US	4	2020-01-12	5.0.5	becca7111	Dragon Mania legends	This game is very fun, but you most of the time have to wait 10 hours and even more for the eggs to hatch and for a lot of other stuff in the game and you have to spend a lot of real money to get the gems to fast forward or be done with it. Besides that this game is awesome.

US	4	2020-01-12	5.0.5	mom nora	Great game, Great problem	"DML is a great game. You can raise, battle, enchant, and train dragons. Thumbs Up! But, i’ve got at least 3 problems.

1. Ads. Okay, speeding up things with ads isn’t quite outrageous because you decided to do it, but whenever i leave a den, breeding den, etc. an ad pops up. This ad problem happens to most people but it isn’t the most OUTRAGEOUS, TRAGIC AND HORRIBLE problem.

2. Outrageous waiting time. Sometimes you have to wait 7, 8, 9 hours for food, breeding, or hatching! Sometimes Even 1 or 2 days! Honestly, that feels like a year for that stuff.

3. Final problem, Event time. I mean, how are you going to spend 1 million something gems or gold in one day?! Can you make it longer?

Thanks For Making This! I would love to tell you all my suggestions but it would make my message too long. Bye!"
US	4	2020-01-12	5.0.5	Annastasi2	Great Game!	"I absolutely LOVE this game. The dragons look so cute and the Clans are the greatest. There is just one thing that throws me off:

I was at level 40 and I didn’t play the game for about a week, when I returned to the game it started me all over again at level one.

But other than that I thought it was a really good game and I could play it forever."

I hate how you have to have Facebook and sign into it JUST TO TRANSFER your game!!! On my phone to transfer my progress from my old phone, it wouldn’t show the button in the settings to transfer it. MANDATORY! PLEASE MAKE TRANSFER EASIER. I would play this game way more if i had my progress from my old phone. they are both iphones. PLEASE FIX!!

One thing I don’t like though is that there’s a limit to how many habitats you can get. Right now I have two dragons done breeding but the hatchery has a electric dragon done hatching and it won’t let me get another habitat for it. It says I already got 21/21 habitats. 
Other than that I love the game. (I really like how you can use dragons while they’re breeding or in the academy.)"

US	2	2020-01-03	5.0.2	StarWarsfan#1	This game is a SCAM	"This game is a scam. Or more precisely, the Bottomless Dungeons are a scam. Now this game has always been the type of game where you spend money on it (I personally never have spent money on this game, which is why this new update has made me quite mad), other wise you it takes incredibly long time to level up or to earn anything. I have been playing this game since 2015, and back then it was quite reasonable and it was kind of a hassle to level up but nothing that bad. And they’ve raised the prices for stuff, and I’ve tolerated it quite well, like everything now costs money, but now they have taken it WAY too far with the Bottomless Dungeons. First off, how do they ever expect people to get any weekly dragons from the Dungeon?? It costs 9,015 tokens to get through the dungeon to get all the regular chests. I mean like?? You can regularly only get about 1,200-1600 tokens a day due to the outrageously long wait times which is six hours until you can battle again, getting about 400 tokens each battle. Now we’re gonna asume that most people get about 1,300 tokens per day, because let’s be honest, no one is going to wake up at 6 in the morning and go to bed at 12 at night to get progress in a game. The Dungeon lasts about 7 days and resets each Monday so each day, you would gain 1,300 tokens and that would equal to around 9,100 tokens at the end of the week. So yay, you’ll be able to get all the regular chests, but what about that special chest at the end of the map? The glorious purple chest that promises a special dragon inside? You might think it’s great, it costs 2,000 tokens and sure you could stay up late a few nights and collect that amount to open the chest, It shouldn’t hurt right? You’ll be able to get a new cool dragon right? You are mistaken. You have to open that chest 15 TIMES. That’s right, you haven’t read it wrong, it’s 15 TIMES, which equals to an amount of 30,000 TOKENS. 30,000. Like that’s not even not even possible to finish a single dungeon. Unless if you purchase the highest level of tokens, which is 36,000 tokens, and costs 1,700 Gems. And to buy that amount of gems it would be 50 DOLLARS. So 50 DOLLARS per WEEK. Like are you trying to loose players?? Like I’ve dealt with you guys raising up the prices for stuff, but this is just ridiculous! 

Sincerely,

One of your oldest players."

US	5	2020-01-02	5.0.2	Kim Harmsen	Awesome Game! But still has flaws	I absolutely love this game! But it does have it’s flaws. Such as having to wait for certain things such as breeding, hatching eggs, and energy. This makes the game a bit boring. But the dragons are absolutely adorable and I definitely recommend this app!
US	4	2020-01-02	5.0.2	cokeREVIEWS	Why?	Okay, I’ve made a long review for this before and there was a few things I didn’t like, and you fixed it. But there is a lag that is making me not want to play the game. When I have been upgrading my fire habitats I noticed that some of them disappear into nowhere! Please fix this issue. Also, return my dragons as well. Thank you!
US	3	2020-01-02	5.0.2	im gonna die now	Takes to much time	Sometimes for breeding can take sometimes a week two days and many other things and even loving in can take some time but other than that it’s really fun and amazing and unique
US	4	2020-01-01	5.0.2	007jbond007	Pretty cool	This game is certainly fun and with the updates I constantly keep coming back to it.  I like how everything works except for the fact that it’s hard to get gems and that almost everything costs a large number of them

US	5	2019-12-28	5.0.2	AvaDawn	Amazing game! But one problem.	"So I’ve had this game for at least a week now, I have multiple dragons and I am amazed by the graphics and animations of the whole game in its entirety. I can see how much work you all have put into it and I appreciate it deeply. Now onto my problem. You see, I play on mobile and I’ve been wanting to change my nickname. So I couldn’t figure out how to change it on myself, so I looked it up. It said to go into the settings and scroll to change nickname. I did just that, but yet, I could not find that tab. Anyway, great game, extremely addicting. But I hope you find time to give me some tips. 

Sincerely, Random-support-person."

US	5	2019-12-26	5.0.2	Mulonia	Love this game	I love this game but If just a couple things could be changed I would love even more. The prices for gems and special bundle are way to high I mean I know you are trying to get money since the game is free but $100 ? Way to much and it is really hard to get gems Just change those two things and then so many other people would play this wonderful game too.
US	4	2019-12-26	5.0.2	DML Expert	DML	"Awesome game with constant events and cool new dragons! One of my favorites!👌
One thing you should know, though, before downloading this game is that there seems to be no free time. What I mean is that when events are rolling and there’s a timer in your face, you end up more focused on the event than breeding your normal dragons that you could potentially put on your team, so to sum it up, focus on dragons that would be profitable for your elemental layout.
Tip: Plant element is OP and the Tribal dragon has an enormous amount of health and be obtained early on. Snatch him up and add him to your team!"

US	5	2019-12-26	5.0.2	hhfbfujejhf	Awesome	I have played this game for years it is a great game but there is some time to get up high and it can take hours to breed and wait for it too hatch .
US	4	2019-12-25	5.0.2	amandaholdahl	Love it	Love it but what’s happened to the chat forums
US	3	2019-12-25	5.0.2	BanForYes	TRASH	Okay first of all, the ads. Ads are the 1 thing that makes apps free, but I play on iPad, and idk what it is but whenever I try to click out it rejects and only goes away when I take myself to the recent apps used screen, as if it somehow knows that I’m about to exit it. Second of all, the battles. Tray are super unfair because it always gives your opponent more hits, and dragon fury’s are ridiculously hard to get because the potions don’t even work, and by the time you get one your ether dead or you won.
US	5	2019-12-25	5.0.2	hnvgbfthhvg	Great!	"Tip: don’t spend all your gems first thing! I did...
I love this game no bad things, I also really like how you can get vip tickets without having to pay you just earn them! I can’t think of any concerns or anything wrong with the game except that i would like little animations like them playing when you log on(when I said them I meant the dragon’s). Thanks for making this! It’s way better than dragon city!"

US	5	2019-12-23	5.0.2	Mermicorn TV	Suggestions (READ PLZ)	"This game is the best! I want to gove you some suggestions though. Since I can't log into the forums, I'll have to say it here! So one event I have planned is another breeding blitz event (December 24th - January 3rd)! So, you'll need the frostbite and asteroid dragons to have a chance to breed the reindeer dragon! Another one, obviously is the bottomless dungeon event. The reward would be the snowflake dragon! If you can, the candy cane dragon can be dragon of the week. Also, there should be another calender event (December 25th - January 10th). 
They'll only have sixteen days to get the unicorn dragon. This event would be called ""Magical Sources"" (do not put the quotation marks). Also, can the dragon of the month for January is the Yin Yang dragon? 

Edit: It's okay if you didn't read this review yet. I just played the game today, the dragon if the week was the polar bear dragon, and the  bottomless dungeon has the holly dragon. How about next week we can have the candy cane dragon for the dragon of the week and snowflake dragon for the bottomless dungeon. Keep all other events where I placed them."

US	5	2019-12-23	5.0.2	DragonGirl4Life	5 Stars All The Way!!!!!!!	I am in total love with this game. I’m twelve years old and I love dragons. This game is perfect for people like me and I have a blast when I play this game. The levels are good. I like the different dragons that you can collect during challenges and events. I am a little upset that you have to by the new element dragons, but it’s not very hard for me because I save a lot of money. It’s a little hard to collect fruit and level up dragons once you get the dragons to level sixteen. But other wise, the game will s perfect for dragon lovers of all ages. If you get this game, you will not regret it. Kudos to the designers for doing an awesome job with game and everything else. Keep up the good work!

US	4	2019-12-21	5.0.2	Country_Girl9599	Great! But..	I love this game! My sister had told me about it and I usually don’t like games that you have to wait for things to be done, however I REALLY enjoy this! Only thing is it won’t let me connect to Facebook or use my sisters code to become friends with her. It won’t let her use my code either. I’d really like this fixed because I really enjoy the game and want to be able to play it with her.
US	5	2019-12-21	5.0.2	Some mild angry reviewer	Dungeon battles are iffy	The dungeon is a really interesting mode where you can fight waves of dragons as long as you can. While earning stepping stones to move on an interactive game board to open chests and slowly fill out the map. I like the game mode, but there’s something in the battles mode that is so frustrating. After you beat one of the dragons, another one is summoned to take its place and there behavior after that is so confusing. They’ll either gain a turn and attack or not gain a turn at all and just give it back to you. It was incredible frustrating seeing them gain a turn after I defeat a dragon. They shouldn’t gain a turn back as defeating the dragons should give you time to recover and keep pushing. It’s so aggravating seeing them gain a turn after you defeat a dragon. And sometimes they don’t even get a turn at all when you beat one of there dragons. It’s so inconsistent.

US	4	2019-12-20	5.0.2	Mermicorn TV	Why???????	This game is sooooo confusing! I like it, but when I had V.I.P, It said twelve minutes left. My snowman dragon was hatching, taking two hours left. THEN I WAS SO EXCITED, WAITED TWO LONG HOURS, THEN IT CHANGED BACK TO SIX HOURS! That is just so cruel! Why! WHY!? I almost cried seeing six hours! Can you fix this ASAP? That is confusing! Why would I have TWO hours left then change back to SIX 🙄! I almost threw my phone across the room, SOOOOO IRRITATED! Don&#39;t judge me if I spelled &#34;irritated&#34; wrong because it won&#39;t autocorrect my writing. I just HOPE you fix this super awful error super soon!

 but Pokémon quest is better"
US	5	2019-12-19	5.0.2	Converter44	Amazing game. I have just one thing to say.	The game is amazing. It’s one of my favorite games. The only thing I would add is a breeding button. So you would just look up the dragon you want to breed and then press breed this. Then the recommended dragons to breed would pop up. That would be amazing if they added that. Other than that I think it should be less gems to upgrade the hatchery. And also I think there is a bug in the clam shell. I tried to buy it but it kept on saying there was an error in the store. Please fix that if you can. Also I don’t really like how you have to buy temples to level up your dragons past level 10. Other than that it is an amazing game. Thank you for making it.

US	1	2019-12-18	5.0.2	x mail zing	Not fully functional.😿🥺not cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Ok time to confess. This game can get you addicted and make you spend all your time and money and it has so many things at once that it really gets confusing. Other then that it is kinda a cool and almost completely fine. P.S. DragonML just try to make things look a little more simple!!! 🐲🔥

Love the dragon animations, the different breeds and things, but this game has one major thing wrong with it: it burns through my battery worse than most iOS games. I can start playin it with my battery at full percent, but after 10-15 mins it’s at like 60%! So please devs, fix this so that I can redownload this amazing game without it drainin my battery.
US	3	2019-12-09	4.9.2	idkwhatto wright here	It’s fun but...	It’s really fun but it kept asking me to download more data. It was really annoying because a lot of the things you do in the game REQUIRE you to download more data. It’s annoying and I would recommend to not download this app.

US	3	2019-12-08	4.9.2	Amandaliciousss	It could be a little better	You could like make dragons sick and heal them with potions and if you didn’t they would die. And maybe we could customize the dragons that would be fun
US	5	2019-12-08	4.9.2	UhOhStinkaButt	I love this game	I used to play it all the time as a kid, I recently reinstalled it and I couldn’t be happier. When I used to play this it was hard to get coins, food, win battles etc. But things have changed a lot and there’s so much for me to do I’m never bored. They’ve also added a very helpful ad skip for when you’re waiting on dragons breeding or hatching which is extremely wonderful. I also love the designs this game has. All the dragons are beautiful and each of them is unique. Overall just a great game.

US	2	2019-12-05	4.9.2	CSH8273	Customer Service	I have enjoyed this game on a daily basis for 4 years. I love the variety and many challenges that keep everything interesting. However, in the past few months, the game has been crashing and having loads of errors-lost items, etc. I am sad to say that customer service is a disappointment. I have been assured the issue is being looked into and will be fixed with the next update. Many updates and another loss of progress, I have basically been accused of lying about what was lost. Very disappointed!
US	4	2019-12-04	4.9.2	ZeroSands	Enchantment league	I love this game so much but PLEASEE fix the level scaling for enchantment league it’s almost impossible to progress, I have lvl20s and the level jumps to lvl30s and 40s and I’ve even seen level 60s! It’s takes so much gold just to find a battle I know I have a chance against. The enchantment league is one of my favorite parts of the game but the leveling is just ridiculous.
US	5	2019-12-03	4.9.2	zuzeeq2	This is a awesome game	This game is amazing and there are so many dragons and different islands. but there is one downer that the game does not have the music anymore but still this game is awesome!!?
US	5	2019-12-03	4.9.2	Bahaisksbjdkd	Amazing!	This is the absolute best game of this type I have played. The models and animation are consistent, it is simple, while also being challenging. I’ve had fun petting and feeding my dragons while fighting in quests! Absolutely worth downloading.

US	4	2019-12-02	4.9.2	Huddlebog	Character Design	It’s a great game honestly, at first I was expecting it to be a lot like dragon city, and there are similarities of course but it has its own little unique ideas to, which I love! Everything about the game is great expect for one little thing... CHARACTERS. Honestly I love the different dragons and elements but the dragons designs are very similar to most of the other dragons you get earlier in the game, I find this kinda lazy and I creative an example is the salamander dragon and the first water dragon u obtain, sure there doff colors, but they look very similar. If someone is scrolling through reviews right now,  I recommend you buy this game it’s very fun and entertaining! I just feel like the designs could be better! Thanks! :)

US	4	2019-12-01	4.9.2	Tavonsi the Conquer	Very good game with problem	I love to play DML all the time. I play it every week and enjoy it a lot. BUT there is a problem. Randomly whenever I am going on to it, sometimes it is just a black screen and takes FOREVER to load. I was going to upgrade my hatchery and it happened and when I finally loaded, I had lost a bunch gems! But overall I still think it is a very good game.

US	5	2019-11-30	4.9.2	Menace_34	Awesome game, but a few changes would be nice	So, as a kid with a short attention span/short temper, I get frustrated easily. So when a level beats me, I rage. But it gets really fun when you unlock higher level dragons. Another thing is, is that most really strong dragons are either almost impossible to breed, or you have to pay to get them with REAL MONEY. But the good thing about the paying with real money is that the deals are really good and totally worth it. My mom always says: “Stop wasting time on this stupid app! Do something productive for once in your life!”. Truth is, when you wanna pass time but don’t want to read or color or anything like that, this is the game for you! Edit: Most of the levels are easy, but some are hard so you need to use strategy to pass the level. It produces brain cells! 😜
US	5	2019-11-30	4.9.2	cocobean11()	Cute fun game	This game is amazing for ages 6-12! If your looking for a collectors game, or looking for battles, this is the game for you!
US	5	2019-11-30	4.9.2	Joe Trench coat	Great game few improvements	This is amazing game. Honestly was shocked by quality I was used to mediocre games like this and expected the same quality. So much to do, and with hundreds of regular+ special dragons this game pretty much never ends( I know this doesn’t have a story line(that much of one) but we all get tired of games eventually. But there are a few improvements. It is incredibly hard to level stuff up, after a few levels and hard to keep pace with npc fighters.

I love this game I’ve been playing it for 2 years but I don’t like how to get certain dragons I have to pay REAL money like the dragon that has diamonds I really want to buy it my mom said I can’t so if you can make some things only cost coins from the game that would be great 👍

US	5	2019-11-27	4.9.2	DRAM25	Good	It’s a really good game the only problem I have with it is when I try to log into Facebook when I click it just goes back to the game so it feels like it’s just taunting you that you can’t get the gems and prairie dragon.

US	2	2019-11-24	4.9.2	):$/$:$;$	confused.	I downloaded it again yesterday and it worked fine until I got off it for at least an hour. When I did try getting playing it again, it glitches me back to my home screen after it finishes loading. I shut my phone off twice and it still doesn’t work. I don’t really want to have to delete it and start all over but if I have to it’s not even worth my patience again.
US	4	2019-11-24	4.9.2	AnimalWhisperer9	I like dragon city better	Dragon city is much better than this even though it’s fun. They copied dragon city and made it worse.
US	5	2019-11-24	4.9.2	Maria Palacios	Really good game so far	I just started and it was very good. I just think the game should add a thing called ‘grow to everything’ where if you press the button all the farms would grow the last food. Another thing is you should be able to friend people by typing in their friend code, rather than pasting it. Like how are two iPads gonna friend each other? Good game though!
US	4	2019-11-24	4.9.2	126394037251	Easy but gets Very Fusturating	Well for once this game comes by, and I’m like oh let’s get this ! So I got it played it got a bit frustrated cause like YOU GOTTA pay literally for a legendary? I can understand this but make this fair
US	5	2019-11-24	4.9.2	AdHater351	Ads appearing at the worst times	"I like that the developers listen to the customers, but now I have another problem with these ads. They keep appearing when I am in the middle of doing something, especially when I am tapping on a card pack or petting a dragon. I tap really fast to quickly open or pet something, so I always end up tapping the ad that appears out of nowhere.

So what I want the developers to do is to make it so the ads appear at times when I’m NOT in the middle of tapping on something. That would save a lot of time on having to flip my phone vertically and then clicking the back button on the ad because the back button only appears when the phone is vertical."

US	3	2019-11-23	4.9.2	Talkative Toucan	Lost all my progress	I recently got a New IPhone and I noticed that this game was available on IPhones as well. I previously had an android phone with this exact same app on it. Anyway, I went to log into the app, when it made me redo the “Age and privacy policy” page. I did it, and when I got into the game, all of my stuff was reset to the beginning of level one. I was on level 34, maybe higher and I had a lot of stuff that was limited. Next thing I knew, it was gone. I really want to know if this is fixable- if there is a way for me to get my stuff  back.

The dragons are all so beautiful and cool, as well as 3D so it’s visually appealing. The problem is, well, I logged into Facebook and everything. My phone had to reset later on, so I downloaded this game again the second I was able to, but to my surprise, my progress didn’t return. I was so sad that day. It was the furthest I’ve ever gotten in DML. Please help!

US	1	2019-11-20	4.9.2	Ymir, Frost King	Unable to progress past second stage.	This game seems like it would be genuinely fun, however after completing the Stage 2 battle tutorial I am unable to hit the red X button at the top right of the screen to return home as the giant blue arrow points at it. Every time I try to restart the app I redo the tutorial and it ceases working at that point every single time, any help would be appreciated and raise this review rating in turn.
US	5	2019-11-20	4.9.2	speedy ( real name)	I LOVE IT But.....	I love it so much u get a lot of good dragons but if you get like a good dragon it takes so long it takes like 2 days. But the rest is pretty good,SO YA.
US	5	2019-11-19	4.9.2	JoJoDarkBubbles	Fun game	Been playing this game every day (I think I missed two days...) and I truly enjoy the game. I don’t spend any money on it but they give you plenty of opportunities to earn gems. Just gotta really save. Like really really save. Took me several months to get 2000 but I wasn’t doing everything I can to earn the gems. Casual play. Lol. It’s repetitive but it is easy and interesting.  Honestly used to be more fun when the general chat was open. Could recruit more people easier and actually get active clans. :/ Side from that, it’s still good!
US	4	2019-11-19	4.9.2	flogigo	This game is great just one thing…	I was on there and I loved the being on dragon mania legends for a long time here is your prize but there are so many in app purchases and there has to be other ways to get tickets for the ancient dragon chests. There was some thing similar to that the Egyptians dragon and there ways to get chest were others didn’t like this experience. I would like to request ways to get them like prizes for being in DML for so long that’s all. Great game though.

I might even need more than a million food to conquer the normal and Heroic mode 🤣! I&#39;m kind of impatient in this game though--but that&#39;s not your fault that everything takes so long. You just wanted it to be more fun! 

I love this game soooooooooo much and love the detail!!! P.S. Did you really put more than 600 dragons 🤩???

Thank you Gameloft!!! 🤩😛😜"

If that what they mean by afk arena than this is afk arena. Not only is it chill it's actually fun. I play it every day. This is the game that cured my depression. So I suggest this game to anyone even kindergarteners because I was a kindergartener when I started playing this. That was back in the late 2014 and I still play it to this day.

The hatching of the dragons takes tooo long, and many people would never have enough gems to buy anything, unless they are pay to win, which sadly, I am not. Also, could you guys make VIP tickets that last longer for cheaper? I’m glad that the software and animation is great, but please try making things easier and cheaper to obtain.

US	5	2019-11-13	4.9.1	KenzieRenae	What’s in the game!!	This game is amazing! All’s you do is download it. I used to be obsessed with it on an old tablet I had three years ago, I played it for about a year and my tablet broke. I was upset, because at this time I wanted to spend money I had gotten on the game to get diamonds and all that. I did, on my moms kindle. This is open to all devices, and if you get people join DML you get awesome rewards, like diamonds. You basically make an account and it walks you through a territorial and you get your first dragon, the Fire Dragon. It shows you how to breed and how to basically play the game. That’s just the basics. There is literally UNLIMITED dragons you can get. For example, I’m level 51 currently, and I have over 300 dragons and I’m not even CLOSE to having a lot of dragons. It’s not a game you can play for a month and done, and it’s and unending game there’s always something new. This game has so many options you always have something to do. You can keep breeding dragons, upgrade habitats and buildings, but new islands, clear islands, collect gold and food, farm, feed your dragons (which levels them up), and explore their elements. You can even come up with names for them!! Also, if you make a mistake of putting one in the wrong habitat, that’s alright, just move it! You can also sell unwanted dragons. My top dragon is Arbo, he’s a lynx dragon, and his elements are fire, earth, and Lightning. To level up a dragons elements you assign them to academy. Now, if you were thinking that that alone isn’t a lot, don’t fear, that’s not even all the basics. You can decorate your islands with decorations. As well battle against other people’s dragons in the arena, and there are battles through the portal. The portal gives you challenging battles to match your level, some of them require you to upgrade your dragon to match the difficulty. (This gives you rewards like gold, food, and stuff related to current events which I’ll explain after enchantment) there’s a thing called enchantment. You have these materials that you fuse to get better materials. It also enables to breed dragons that aren’t open to normal breeders who don’t have or use enchantment. There’s types of dragons, common, which anyone can get, uncommon, which most can get, rare, these ones are harder to get than epic dragons are for me, epic, these dragons are rarer and have three elements, Legendary, these dragons have a powerful element as well two other elements that awaken as you level it up, divine, these are hard to get but worth it, boss dragons, these ones are top dog, the cost gems and can’t be bred, they also need a special habitat. Now, the events. They offer special events to earn dragons, and rewards. You earn these by doing simple things, to get pieces. For example, the Ancient Dragons recently came to DML. Ancient dragons are  all new and I’m not sure about their elements or how strong it is yet. Either way, you do simple tasks and get emberstones. You use the emberstones to roll dice, you go around the board and collect keys, and the keys give you pieces to the dragons, and once you get all the pieces you receive the dragons, and right now there was an event to see who farmed the most, or collected the most gold, and you would win rewards for this. I love DML!!! It’s an awesome and entertaining game, don’t miss out and download!!!
US	4	2019-11-13	4.9.1	YoshingtonPost	Great but not perfect	The Game has an incredible storyline and it also has much to offer with constant events and new content being added regularly and what seems like never ending adventure. This game truly is incredible and I can’t wait to see what is else is in store for the future. Like most other dragon games it seems quite basic in the beginning however it is set apart by its team gameplay and gifting system. The game has quite some ads and ridiculously long wait times and recharges which docks one star from the score but everything else makes it fun. The game is free to play and everything is possible to do and complete without having to pay even one cent.Resources can be stockpiles pretty easily and they need to be stockpiled for advanced items and dragons and these advanced tools are necessary to progress further through the game.Basically the game is incredible and free to play but it takes a lot of time to master techniques and stockpile resources.
US	4	2019-11-12	4.9.1	ivoryok	Get it	They have fixed all of my problems with their app go and get it I will keep the app forever as long as they keep listening to their people make getting dragons easier to get during events and I’ll give 5 stars

US	5	2019-11-11	4.9.1	adope me	This game awesome	I like my dragons as much as this game
US	1	2019-11-11	4.9.1	dont use topspot	Most unprofessional developers in 20 years of online gaming	They have known glitches in every event they run and do not fix them. The most recent was a massive update and they had no staff all weekend for an issue that was making the game roll back in time and making it unplayable. Most pathetic people I’ve ever made the mistake of dealing with (btw I’ve played for months and the problems are only getting worse). Stay away no matter what it’s not fun at all losing the progress you make with no compensation
US	5	2019-11-11	4.9.1	soulsisplayz	GOOD JOB!	Five stars all the way! This game is amazing you should totally download it i haven’t had any issues with it! I haven’t seen any problems with it, it’s a generally fun game you never run out of things to do on it. And it’s easier to get gems on here than any other game I’ve played that’s just satisfying and makes the game better thanks gameloft it’s amazing! Keep up the good work! 👍
US	5	2019-11-10	4.9.1	;-; idk ;-;	It should have updates and i love it	The game is veryyyy fun :D

US	5	2019-11-10	4.9.1	PandaJana	Awesome🤩🤩	I’ve been playing this game on and of since it was released and I LOVE this game I have no complaints. This game is constantly giving u awesome and cool things to do.if there is two things I could change it would be making friending easier and being able to play the same account on multiple devices. I would also suggest that you make a board game and action figures. Because I’m sure that I would buy them.

US	1	2019-11-08	4.9.1	Luigi.exe	Infinite Loading Screen	Ever since the event started, I can’t open the game without a random loading screen appearing and making it impossible to play the game. Reloading doesn’t work, and I don’t feel like reinstalling the app at the moment. Fix this, Gameloft! I want to be able to actually play the new event!
US	5	2019-11-08	4.9.1	DeCoded_Dragons	I LOVE THIS GAME	This game is amazing. I think the only problem is how adds just randomly pop up. So if I’m clicking something and an add pops up I click on the add. Other then that though I’m very happy with the game, the events are fun and hard, but not too hard. So fun.
US	5	2019-11-08	4.9.1	Violet210	Listen here!	I accidentally hit I am not enjoying! I’m enjoying it a bunch!

US	5	2019-11-07	4.9.1	Fun!!,hit!	Very fun!!!	I LOVE dragon ml.  I play dragon city, and have tried others, and this is a great game.  I love the simplicity of it, such as a few hundred dragons, versus thousands, and I love how simple and cute the dragons are.  I like that it takes skill to fight, and win, and I like that you can enchant dragons to be better.  The only bad things is that it takes a long time to get the right enchanter things to enchant new dragons, and there is only one evolution.   But I love DML! Download it right now, please!
US	1	2019-11-07	4.9.1	herobrine is nice	I HATE THIS GAME WORST GAME IN THE WORLD DONT DOWNLOAD	"I’ve played dragon mania but now I quit. I think things are too expensive and you should allow more dragons per habitat. It’s also very very very very very very hard to get legendary enchants. Also, I’ve been playing for 2 years without purchase and all I get to is level 20. To feed my legendary dragons I have 8 level 2 farms and plant the most expensive. That whole thing only gets me ONE BITE with my lvl 20 dragon. That is completely ANNOYING. Enchantment league, ur putting me up against level 30 level and like lvl 3 enchantment. This game is way to hard. I played 2 years and now in hate myself for wasting time. More complaining, waiting is soooooooooo longggggg.
And basically every time I breed I get a not new, boring, thing. I have clearly expressed my hate for this game and I say that you don’t even bother downloading it. You will prob end up spending like 1000 dollars on this. I. HATE. THIS. GAME. The only thing that stopped me from playing is my parents. Since I am a kid, I can’t really play any games because my parents don’t allow it. I was playing secretly. I got discovered, I can’t download, and I can’t play. Very time wasting. Play something like Minecraft instead. You might need to pay at the beginning, but it’s nothing compared to the money your probably gonna spend on dragon mainia. Let’s talk about cost of real money and fake. Those gems are very hard to earn if you can’t buy them. Dragons are hard to get. I can’t upgrade my nursery! Habitats are way to big and take up space. They don’t have enough places to put dragons, and due to all of these dumb stuff I have about 15 dragons sitting in storage. You should let us start with 3 slots! After you play for a while this game becomes boring. In the start, you have a lot of things to do. Then after that it’s all breeding and hatching and fighting and planting. The worst thing is, real money. In the first few stages of DML people love gems. They want them, so they’ll buy them. And how much does that cost? At first, you buy one packet. You see how “useful” it is, and buy more. And more. And more. Until you realize your spending money on a dumb game. That’s all I have to say,  it I’ll be updating this."
US	4	2019-11-07	4.9.1	Mani Chahaun	It doesn’t make sense!	I don’t think dragons can fight while they’re breeding.
US	5	2019-11-07	4.9.1	BeastBoy55151	The best game!	This game is soooooooooo awesome! I can’t stop playing it. And a suggestion is that when u make a new element u should talk with Mojang and make another dragon/ender dragon with an element like the water element can’t heel it for like 2 or 3 turns. Good idea?
US	5	2019-11-07	4.9.1	Roxy716	I love this game	If you like dragons this is the game for you I is so easy to get Jem’s not like other games. Sooooo you should get this game 🐉
US	3	2019-11-07	4.9.1	Ab148hf	It’s alright	I would say this game is okay but the amount of ads they show is absurd. There have been multiple cases of me wanting to pick up food or check my dragons and a pop ad comes along and I hit and get zapped to my webrowser.
US	5	2019-11-06	4.9.1	David2118soone	Awesome game	This game is awesome eve though I have to wait a lot because I don’t have many gems, still this game is awesome 5/5

US	2	2019-11-04	4.8.2	mangosloth21	Why	When I first reinstalled this game I saw a real info registration, and I was like ok and when I completed it, it said something on the lines of  “Sorry the game servers are down! We’re working as fast as possible to remedy the situation.” And so I pressed register later and after a week of doing so, it doesn’t give me the option to register later and now I have lost 4 years of progress.
US	5	2019-11-04	4.8.2	Jayp2828	Dragon Fun!	I LOVE Dragon Mania Legends because it’s silly, mystical, adventurer made for, and totally awesome! Get this game now like your life depends on it because it TOTALLY does, and prepare to be addicted! This game is extra fun for people who love adventure, mystical creatures, and awesomeness!

US	5	2019-11-03	4.8.2	magic5D	💮MY REVIEW💮	Wow! This game has come so far since I downloaded it four years ago. It’s been awesome seeing this game grow and I can see why it has a 4.8 rating! I like the Clans and all of the events, too. If I had to suggest one thing that would make this game even better is a trading system to trade dragons/items. Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day 💗💗💗

US	4	2019-10-30	4.8.2	Mefgo	Time Limits	It’s an awesome game, I’ve been looking for a game like this! However, the time limit for things is just out of control. For example, to get a common water mixed dragon it takes six hours. To get a E dragon, it takes almost more than a day. Please fix this to a more reasonable time limit, thank you!

Ok this game is amazing I have played many dragon games like this and I wanted to start playing this one and it is really good and fun and entertaining but I feel like there is a lack of features  you guys could add so many new features to this game and add many more dragons!!! And I feel like there should be more detail in the dragons just to make it feel like you guys put a lot of work into the game and make it look it better for the fans. So just more features and detail in the game and it could be the best mobile dragon game like this.!!

US	1	2019-10-19	4.8.2	£€XI€	SEROUSLY!!!!!	"Let me tell you a story: I played dragon mania for 3 years. One day I got on my game, and all of my progress somehow disappeared. I had to start all of the way from scratch. I am so upset and angry, I lost all of my dragons... I only had 3 legendary dragons though. They were the legendary dragons from the ""Stronger Together"" event. They were the Aloe dragon, Carmine Dragon, and my favorite: the Marano dragon. I LOST EVERYTHING I WORKED HARD ON!!! The only way I would ever feel better was if Gameloft found my old account (my username was £€XI€) and changed it to my new account (my username is now £€XI€12) or if they can't fix my account, then at least bring back those three legendary dragons, because those dragons were really special on my other account..."

US	4	2019-10-15	4.8.2	loadingyourname	Me and my brother..	I love this game so much! I always come back to it after long periods of rest. Something that I didn’t like was that me and my brother can’t be friends on the game. I recruited him to join the game, and he agreed. So I told him my code and nothing happened. It made me so sad to see we couldn’t even be friends. Do device types such as iOS and Android cause errors? I can’t see my little brother and he is on Android.
US	5	2019-10-15	4.8.2	i ❤️dogs2727	Fantastical game😍	This is a great game probably the best I have ever played let my give you some feedback there are lots of dragons but it is pretty hard to level up you and your dragons and I say that you need to down the time for things like when you are hatching your dragons. Some things cost TOOOOO many gems  ether down the prices or find out a way to get more gems.🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😭🥵🤯 Other wise this is a TOTALLY ENJOYABLE GAME 😁😁😂😂🙃🙃😍😍😍😝😝😎😎😎🤩🤩🥳

US	4	2019-10-13	4.8.2	ChaoticDragonLover	Amazing but...	"I think this game is amazing I love how you can see your friends worlds. I recommend this to anyone who loves dragons. But it should be easier to get gems and things that you can buy with gems shouldn’t be so expensive. That’s my only complaint 
P.S. If you’re thinking about downloading this app...
DO IT"
US	4	2019-10-12	4.8.2	TacoCommisions	Great game but with a small disappointment	I love this game, it’s absolutely amazing, however in the dungeon, when you reach the final chest that costs about 2,000 dungeon stepping stones to open, if you want a with-out-a-doubt weekly dragon, prepare to reach the end of the dungeon, reach the final chest, farm more for stepping stones, open the chest, and then be told “If you want that, you have to get 2,000 stones 14 more times! Oh there are only 21 hours left of the event? Well tough luck!” Not everyone can purchase gems to buy stuff, so can you guys at Gameloft make it so that you only have to open the chest once to get the weekly prize? It takes most of the week to even GET to the end, I just want a reward that won’t be unreasonable to get. Thank you!
US	2	2019-10-12	4.8.2	StarWarsfan#1	This game is a SCAM	"This game is a scam. Or more precisely, the Bottomless Dungeons are a scam. Now this game has always been the type of game where you spend money on it (I personally never have spent money on this game, which is why this new update has made me quite mad), other wise you it takes incredibly long time to level up or to earn anything. I have been playing this game since 2015, and back then it was quite reasonable and it was kind of a hassle to level up but nothing that bad. And they’ve raised the prices for stuff, and I’ve tolerated it quite well, like everything now costs money, but now they have taken it WAY too far with the Bottomless Dungeons. First off, how do they ever expect people to get any weekly dragons from the Dungeon?? It costs 9,015 tokens to get through the dungeon to get all the regular chests. I mean like?? You can regularly only get about 1,200-1600 tokens a day due to the outrageously long wait times which is six hours until you can battle again, getting about 400 tokens each battle. Now we’re gonna asume that most people get about 1,300 tokens per day, because let’s be honest, no one is going to wake up at 6 in the morning and go to bed at 12 at night to get progress in a game. The Dungeon lasts about 7 days and resets each Monday so each day, you would gain 1,300 tokens and that would equal to around 9,100 tokens at the end of the week. So yay, you’ll be able to get all the regular chests, but what about that special chest at the end of the map? The glorious purple chest that promises a special dragon inside? You might think it’s great, it costs 2,000 tokens and sure you could stay up late a few nights and collect that amount to open the chest, It shouldn’t hurt right? You’ll be able to get a new cool dragon right? You are mistaken. You have to open that chest 15 TIMES. That’s right, you haven’t read it wrong, it’s 15 TIMES, which equals to an amount of 30,000 TOKENS. 30,000. Like that’s not even not even possible to finish a single dungeon. Unless if you purchase the highest level of tokens, which is 36,000 tokens, and costs 1,700 Gems. And to buy that amount of gems it would be 50 DOLLARS. So 50 DOLLARS per WEEK. Like are you trying to loose players?? Like I’ve dealt with you guys raising up the prices for stuff, but this is just ridiculous! 

Sincerely,

One of your oldest players."

US	3	2019-10-10	4.8.2	boutchiquette19	Ruined by updates	This game really got ruined by updates,I already wrote a review on this game and I gave this game 5 ⭐️ but it’s gotten ruined by updates, and I don’t like it anymore, so this is why I’m starting not to like it:so, today I noticed that the game changed my player name to dragon master 703173 and before it was Alexandra, plus I payed 5 gems to get my name done.So now I am very disappointed ☹️ ....... plus I hate the dungeon update because the dragons in the dungeon are practically impossible to get. So can you please change the game back to how it was before?!?!?!?I really hope I get a response from the developers.

US	3	2019-10-09	4.8.2	kg.ajg44	A Rant About This Game And How To Fix It	"I think the enchantment league would be better and more balanced if your league depended on the level of your dragons. That means no more anger and frustration over losing trophies because overpowered players keep attacking you.

Next, I feel that charging TWO ENERGY to attempt heroic battles is very unnecessary and unjustified. You are essentially charging us more just to play on a higher difficulty.

Next, I think divine chests should have a higher chance to give legendary pieces because a good portion of divine dragons are ONLY SLIGHTLY STRONGER THAN LEGENDARY DRAGONS! Divine dragons should be much easier to obtain if they are only a little bit stronger than legendary dragons. If you are not going to make divines easier to get, then why not improve their skills so they feel more rewarding.

Finally, I feel that you intentionally make events impossible to complete without spending real currency. Some events like the castles are CLEARLY DESIGNED FOR HIGH LEVEL PLAYERS WHO WILL SPEND THEIR FORTUNE ON THIS GAME TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY AND SEVEN DAYS A WEEK! Which is something YOU should be ashamed about.

If these changes are made, I COULD give this four or even five stars. Until then, I will keep my rating of three out of five stars.

P.S. I KNOW YOU WILL NEVER MAKE THESE CHANGES BECAUSE YOU GAMELOFT, ARE SUCH A GREEDY COMPANY THAT PROFITS OFF OF OTHER PLAYER’S MISFORTUNES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET A DRAGON THEY REALLY WANT.
DragonVale is clearly the winner when it comes to dragon games like this would-be piece of garbage >:( 
Angry Rant over."

US	4	2019-10-08	4.8.2	nothing it see here	excellent game only Thera one annoying glitch	So I love this game so much I play it every day and I am addicted to it but I did end up taking a long break away from it and now I am playing it agin but when I started playing it in 2019 I noticed this glitch that kept on happing so I would be playing and then all of a sudden an add would pop up so of course I would wait for the x button to happen but it just didn’t happen it was stuck on the loading screen waiting for the add. So it is a pretty good game but if they could fix that then it would make it better.

But I’m dealing with some glitches, I was mating my lava and water dragon, I was bored so I logged off and I played Love dress up Nikki (not a baby game). I logged on a little bit later and it said my dragons would be done in 11 hours, but they were already done mating but there was no egg, I was sad because I was hoping to get a rare dragon. And I suggest you make a new look for a dragon cause some kinda look the same in a way, but I still like the game! See ya later peeps😁😁
US	5	2019-10-04	4.8.2	kitten lover1928627	Amazing but...	"Okay, I love this game! Petting the dragons and feeding after a long day just makes me happy. The friend code idea is genius, I don’t use Facebook or well, much social media at all so this is a big help! One thing though, the screen is very clustered. A quick fix for this is an arrow button to remove pronations, events and every thing (well maybe not ads but ya know). This would make the experience much more enjoyable.

It’s the only dragon game I’ve played before, since us girls aren’t  usually into dragons and legends(except for Phoenix’s I love them) and all that. But this game is truly awesome.tho their are a few downs, I alwase just look past them. The thing I don’t like about it is that I can never upgrade any of the things in the quest list! I mean, I can but, it doesn’t let me since I’m only on level 7.maybe 8.. I don’t remember.But besides the small downs, I am proud to say that it’s a 5 star game. Even though I e only played it for 2 days now.. and yes I got to level 7 in 2 days, thank you.

I would have given this game 3 stars if not for the fact that at 90 days into the game it gives you a reward, which you guessed it-Is a legendary dragon!!! I was sooo happy, and ill add that other that that this game is SUPER addictive (in a good way i guess). So grab your phone, iPad, tablet, computer and start playing!!!
US	5	2019-09-28	4.8.2	WolfieTheAlphaOfGacha	PLEASE READ I love your game!	"So first every time I get one of those things asking if I enjoy the game so far I sometimes click no on accident because I think it’s another weird lunchable add. 
So I’m really sorry if I clicked no. Also YOUR GAME IS AMAZING!!! And I think it’s perfect except for some little things like all those lunchable ads ALL THE TIME! So please add a feature that allows you to buy no ads for a dollar or so. Also you could maybe add no ads into the game 😂

But other than ads your game is perfect and thanks hog win. Also please do clan chat or asking to join like if you want to join you could say “hi can I join please” but not “I WIILL JOIN OR ELSE” because of possible threats. Also maybe add personalizing your character like making a character from different styles of hair shirt pants and shoes also accessories and chose the color.

US	5	2019-09-27	4.8.2	Felinis😺	Super fun, but a tweak is needed	"This game involves managing space and currency, as well as the obvious theme of dragons. Several aspects that I really enjoy are the incubation period for eggs, the ability to breed two dragons to get an entirely new one, and the farming for food to level up your dragons, though the former and latter can be a tad tedious.
However, my only complaint is that while some dragon designs are really creative, some dragons are literally just recolorings of other dragons, like the Magma Dragon and its lime-colored counterpart, the Geiger Dragon. Or the Smoke and Witch Dragons. Or the Water and Candy Dragons. Or the Earth and Tribal Dragons...you get the idea. 
Overall, this is a really creative and fun game."

US	4	2019-09-26	4.8.2	ickfmcifmkcmdc	Way to much money for bundles	Dragon Mania Legends is a good game overall. But I have a problem, the BUNDLES they cost WAY TO much MONEY. So basically you can buy something for 5 bucks that used to be 10 bucks and it gives you 300 VIP points. Right? Well, there is a bundle that is 100 bucks and it gives like 100 VIP points, but it does give you a legendary dragon. But still that’s way to much money for something like that. You guys also did that with the GEMS, look listen to me, 100 bucks for 3,500 gems right. But since you added the special event crap, now its 100 bucks for 7,500 gems it should have been like that and then you would have gotten it more money, better rates on App Store, and SO much else, but NO! Hey all you guys gotta do is lower prices and other stuff I said in this review and then I will be a lot happier with this game. But it is a great game and I love it, Thank You!

US	5	2019-09-17	4.8.0	Jdalton17	I have an idea	"Dragon mania legends is the best mobile game I’ve ever played, there’s nothing I would change about it! But I do have an idea for a new feature. You should put in wether. Like, every so often it would rain then clear up after a while. The sky would become grey and maybe some thunder if the player had sound on. But you would also have the option to turn wether off in settings. And the rain would vary from island to island, like the main grassy one would be normal rain, the sand one would have no rain, just grey sky, the swamp/marsh one would be slightly foggy with rain, and polar rock would snow, etc. (sorry I don’t know all the names of the islands) maybe you could also add day and night to, with the option to turn it off, where it would include sunrise and set, day and night. And at night the dragons habitats would slightly light up to produce light. And maybe certain decorations would produce light at night.

I know this all probably won’t happen but if you read it all then thanks! And I hope you like the idea :)"

We need free gems!!!!!!!!!"

US	5	2019-09-13	4.8.0	gilliannicsmith	game	it’s a great thing to play on a road trip
US	5	2019-09-12	4.8.0	P o l	The Best game EVER	Ive voy this game since i have 9 years
US	5	2019-09-11	4.8.0	Nyel yaseen Huq	Addictive	Really addictive game once you get into it.  Enchantment league is one of the broken parts of the game that can use a lot of improvement but pretty fun regardless overall.  My wallet isn’t as happy though.
US	5	2019-09-11	4.8.0	Dan and Gabe	Dumb update	When this update came out, it erased my player name, and I can’t chat in my clan anymore! Fix this problem please
US	3	2019-09-11	4.8.0	Mentole	More and more about the money	"I use to like this game but it is getting new and more about paying cash to get things. Perfect example, this past event I was tight on cash so I couldn’t buy any gems. Normally I am able to easily get all the event dragons except the main which is definitely about getting really lucky or paying $100+ to get it. However this time I couldn’t even get the legendary. It should have been fine as I already had it but it was part of a collection and I needed the collection Dragon, and I already had the other 2 dragons with in the first week of the event. I don’t see why we have to get a dragon you already have just to complete the collection. That is them just trying to get more money from things you already have. Like paying twice for the same thing. 

And the game has just been getting worse. I will no longer spend a dime on this game because of the direction it is going."
US	5	2019-09-11	4.8.0	Mohamed Muzahim	OMG	OMG this game is the legend of the games because this game is epic I can breed dragons and buy islands now I have more than 50 dragons.you might think this is a boring game from the outside but not see the inside it is much better than you think.I am sure if you download this game you will play it for 24 hours straight.And everyone you should download this game and play it.It is superb.And share this with others so even they play DML(Dragon Mania Legends)
US	5	2019-09-11	4.8.0	blinkfans	I love it and will always	I love the fact that their are varieties of dragon. I can tell you put lots of effort into DML. I believe that there should be more challenges that even new people could do. Like dungeon and like the afterlife adventure it was more for the people who played it and no for new people. I believe that this game is amazing and you should download it. I doesn’t take that much time. All you need is to spend like 15 mins on it and you can get tons of crazy items and dragons. I am looking foward to all the new updates and dragons such as the water lily for the log in. I am very thankful to the creators of this game. That they put in time and money to make this a better game not for themselves only but for only as well. I hope that everyone gets a chance to play this game. It is much your time and money. I look forward to making new friends from all across the world and working with new clans to mate with. I will love this game til the day I die.

US	4	2019-09-11	4.8.0	Natalie da bean :3	I really like this game :3	This is a great game for sure, there’s so many cool things to do! And this is my first time writing a review too lol. There’s so many dragons that you can hatch! And I love how there’s many different worlds, or islands to build on. Idk what else to say xD
US	5	2019-09-10	4.8.0	ERinSPI	Graphics nice	My daughter loves this game.  The graphics are nice, the dragons look cool, it has some great features.  She enjoys it very much.
US	4	2019-09-10	4.8.0	dark valtreyak	Chat	The clan chat has been removed why I miss talking to my friends on the game and it’s stupid to tear friendships apart and I feel like I have no way to communicate with them now that there is no more chat.i can’t change my name from dragon master to drakemore. I think I’m just going to delete this game if I can’t talk to my friends so are y’all going to fix it or am I gonna delete the only game on my phone

US	5	2019-09-07	4.7.0	Gava juce	Lol	Its just so good
US	3	2019-09-05	4.7.0	Juanisabeast	Fun but lacks variety!	This game was fantastic in and out up until the point that I realized that a lot of the monsters share similar body types. It wouldn’t have been a problem had it been one or two but many of them are exactly the same body shape and size only with a certain twist like a different element or a not so significant addition. I think the game is nice, but it definitely doesn’t hold its own against other games of its kind simply based on its lack of variety and originality. This comes off as lazy in comparison to other games which don’t even have two monsters that are exactly alike.
US	1	2019-09-05		MotherWith2Kids	My son cried and my neighbors complained.	The legendary James Charles dragon was hatching on my phone and my son said “What’s that?” so I showed him and then he started crying. Game got my father a ticket.

US	5	2019-09-04	4.7.0	dragronmaster	The coolest	Well I can’t explain how much fun you’re going to let us have any picture right
US	5	2019-09-03	4.7.0	#rokycat	AMAZING!!! But...	I love this game overall, but there is ONE thing that I would add... FRIEND BATTLES!!! I know, there are complications... but maybe there could be a system! For example, if one person sends an invite, it could last for 20-30 minutes and then automatically delete itself after that deadline? To give the challenged player the me to see the invite, just an idea!
US	5	2019-09-02	4.7.0	Ifyodufugigufufufu	Best game ever🤣😂😂😻	I love ❤️ dragons 🐉 so I love 💗 dragon mania legends I love the way the graphics look and I also love games 🎮.

You’re never bored with all the quests they throw at you, and the game itself is really well made. Haven’t even seen a SINGLE glitch! Underrated for sure.

US	5	2019-08-28	4.7.0	geonswhdrvahblft	Great Game	The only flaw of the game is that you only have 3 times to fight other dragons then you wait an hour to get the energy back, otherwise I love this game!👍👍
US	5	2019-08-27	4.7.0	grant boom	Awesome but one little frustration	I think this is a great game but I feel there needs to be more things you can do with your friends. Specifically, I feel that there should be a way that you can trade dragons with friends.
US	5	2019-08-26	4.7.0	aawantonio	Antonio review	I’ve always played dragon Melanie legends I think it’s a great game on another device I remember having more progress and I continue to start with something fresh and new

US	5	2019-08-26	4.7.0	The Raven Dragon Master	Great game, Just........	I love this game. It’s so much fun and one of Gamelofts best games. I started playing it when it was first released and I love how they keep improving and making the game better. It’s just the fact that the screen is extremely crowded. There’s not enough space to see anything and I want to give it a five but I can’t because of this. It’s hard to see what’s going on and nearly impossible to see the dragons and their animations. The worst part is the fact that I know how hard it is to animate the dragons and how much time they put into making them so they can’t even be seen because the screen is just so crowded. It’s still a really good game and I recommend it to anyone who likes dragons or just cute and cool things too. I just think it would be more enjoyable if this problem was fixed.
US	5	2019-08-25	4.7.0	girlydigs	Best	The game is so fun

US	5	2019-08-22	4.7.0	G0lDf1$h	This game is amazing... but	"I have been playing this game for a few years now and I love it!
Except one aspect. THE WHOLE GAME RELIES ON SPENDING MONEY AND GAMBLING!!!! It would be so much more enjoyable for everyone if this game wasn’t pay to win and involved less gambling aspects!? The “Ottos Lotto” and mystery chest opening nonsense really ruined the game for a lot of players!!!
This game is a great idea, is great, but it also definitely needs some work.
Thanks, Freddie"
US	5	2019-08-22	4.7.0	Alpha Wolf Gaming 13	Please read.    I’m sad	"I love this game and I think this is a good idea. I came home today and found a hawk feasting on my rooster named hei hei . I ran over and fell to the ground sobbing. I loved that rooster, but I would love to have a chicken dragon as a reminder to him. He is a small Banty ( I think that is how it’s spelled) please add this into the game 
Thank you

I like it 😄, and I am angry 😡😠"
US	5	2019-08-20	4.7.0	why you read my username	Very good	Dragon mania legends is a very good game to play when your bored. The dragons are very unique and the overall art in the game is very good. I prefer this game over dragon legends. The powers in each dragon and even and fair. This game might have its obstacles but you can do it.

There’s nothing really wrong with this game. Except that it’s not letting me explore anymore, I don’t know if it’s just a bug, or if it’s happening to anyone else. Other then that this game is really fun and I do recommend it!
US	5	2019-08-15	4.7.0	Dragon meem	It’s the best game but	The prices for gems are too high and they should add a rainbow dragon and a boss dragon that dark and fire . And the rainbow dragon should have water fire and leaf

US	4	2019-08-08	4.7.0	Mystic_Demigod	Great game but.	I’ve really enjoyed it for a while till a day I stopped since 2 years of play. It’s very simple, but one thing I want is a dragon that has the theme of fantasy, like a fantasy dragon of some sort. Easy to get and push motivation for the players.
US	5	2019-08-08	4.7.0	••sunflower••	Great game	Dragon Mania Legends is a great game. Its very entertaining and even if you get bored of playing it you can find something else to do because there’s a ton of options. For those complaining about buying gems, it’s only a dollar for twenty five, and they have sales and discounts often, so stop saying that it takes all your money. You can always earn gems and stuff by watching ads, too. The amount of ads in this game isn’t bad at all, there’s barely any. This is my overall favorite game, although you are allowed to chat to people at lvl 25 which takes a few months to get to. Though there is a safety blocker so nobody can say bad things, and the chat is basically just asking people for supplies. Though I suggest you add more elements such as Invisibilty or something so it’s not just the basics, and maybe more dragons if you get the chance.
US	5	2019-08-06	4.7.0	chris (pro16)	Not the BEST game but pretty good	"On the notifications it said my dragon hatched and my fruit was ripe and ready so when I turned on dragon mania legends it didn’t work it just kept on saying all the servers were shut down.

US	4	2019-08-04	4.7.0	RavenShadow10	Good Game, But I’m Confuzzled	"Ok, I love this game. I personally think it’s an amazing waste of my time (as my friends say a lot). 
The dragons are adorable, but I wish all the models were different! Sometimes, I sit and think, ok, flippers? No. Four legs? No.... ok so it must have stubby arms and be able to fly! 
But I am confused! I was just randomly playing DML one day, not having done any breeding whatsoever, and had just finished DESTROYING the dungeon to get my favorite little dragon, the robot dragon. Then, this appears~ CONGRATULATIONS!
And there are 3 AMAZING legendaries from the previous month! Not that this is an issue, but it only happened once and I’d like to know WHY. Thanks!"

US	3	2019-08-02	4.7.0	S.D.Smith	At least you tried. 😒	"This is an amazing game at first when you’re just figuring it out. However, after a while or even just a month of playing it, it gets old. IT NEEDS A “CHANGE” UPDATE! It’s also kinda hard. I’ve gotten up to...I don’t remember which level, but I’M STUCK. I can’t get past it. It’s one of the bigger, harder boss levels, I think. Developer, please make a “CHANGE” UPDATE! Again: this game gets unbearably boring after awhile. Despite that, it has cool dragons, awesome stories and IS fun. If just for a bit. But I like “Dragon City” better. 

Sincerely, 
     A serious 12-year-old

(P.S. Developer, please respond!)"

US	4	2019-08-02	4.7.0	jackson.a.b	Great game!small problem tho.	I love dml it’s a great game and has cute dragons!but there’s one problem.limited time dragons.the reason I don’t like them is because some are incredibly frustrating and hard to get and the time you have to get them can be very short and can be 1 to 4 days which I think is short and can be hard to other new players tho it is a great game one other complaint....ADD A EASYER WAY TO GET ARES!

US	4	2019-08-01	4.7.0	Ummmm..... Pepsi?	Adjustments	This game is fun and exciting, but some changes should be made. First of all, I do not understand why some dragons do not have wings. I mean like, don’t dragons have to have wings to be dragons? Second of all, I don’t think you should have to pay for things with REAL money. Like, why does everything have to be REAL money? I think you should pay for things with in-game money, or at least make the REAL money be only $1 or something. Third of all, I think they made you wait too long for things. Breeding takes maybe 5 hours at the LEAST. Searching for chests is 8 hours at the most. Hatching can take 22 HOURS!! I mean like who makes people wait that long? Seriously? And upgrading habitats and farming is fine. Upgrading habitats only takes about 30 minutes, and farming takes 30 sec. — 5 mins. Anyways, I love this game, A LLOOTT but some things I do not like about it. Maybe if you could change some of the things I wanted. Also, I would NEVER stop playing this game If you made them. It is already awesome, but could be better. Thanks!

US	5	2019-08-01		pinkymaliknky	Best game ever	I love the animation and the radon’s themselves. The only con is that I think their should be magic or clear dragons, I also think we could get more gems a little more often.

US	3	2019-07-31	4.7.0	Afwes1	Almost	"I played Dragon City shortly before going to this game and this one is so much better. Dragon Legends Mania sets itself up as an adventure and allows you to interact with the dragons. While Dragon City is a clear scam using frustration to make you buy gems this is a genuinely fun experience. 

That being said I only played it for a few days and quit out of frustration because once you’re well into it the wait times for things becomes ludicrous and the space for your dragons far to limited. 

The thing that made me quit was when I bought an egg for 40000 gold, waited 13 hours for it to hatch, and then had to sell it for 300 gold do to lack of space.

It’s almost a good game but it’s ultimately not worth your time."

US	2	2019-07-30	4.7.0	Ant12235	Don’t bother downloading	The game is fun up until when your dragons get to about level 20. Then you’re forced to pay for gems and food if you want to progress any more. And I have already spent a lot of money on the game and it just feels not worth it. For a common dragon and enough food to get it to level 15 is $15 and you have to pay $100 to get some dragons which is unfair. They add a lot of new content but it’s just not even fun because you just have to keep growing food and battling the same battles you’ve done 1000 times. Don’t download...

US	3	2019-07-27	4.6.1	james5057	Good game but...	It’s a really fun game but because of the constant ads that keep popping up every half minute or so it gets hard to want to really get in to it and play. Maybe five minutes and I’m ready to switch to another game that I could spend an hour or two on if I have the time to kill. It’s fun but only for a few minutes until you get tired of the ads
US	5	2019-07-26	4.6.1	great geamr	Trading Dragons	I recommend that there is a dragon trade in the game so that people like me missed out on the Aries and the Gemini alpha can register them in the codex
US	3	2019-07-26	4.6.1	hammock lover 32	I love this game!😀	I love this game so much and am so addicted to it! There was one major problem that I encountered and it was very frustrating. When ever I tried to buy a habitat it told me that my habitats were maxed out. The game will not let me buy any more habitats and if I earn one it won’t let me build it. Now the weird thing is that I have only 23 habitats total, definitely not enough to be to maxed out on everything. This is a real problem since I have had a baby dragon sitting in the nest for over 2 weeks! It is really a great game but the bugs were a huge letdown.

US	4	2019-07-23	4.6.1	crispybubble	Unreasonable	The game is amazing I’ve been playing for at least 3 years. But I recently purchased an extra breeding den for 30 DAYS. It went away at 27. I’m a bit upset about that. 5 dollars for something I was guaranteed but never given. This game also drains your money and is unreasonable with the prices for purchases. You never get your moneys worth honestly.
US	4	2019-07-23	4.6.1	PurpleEyedSkull	Friends Issue	This game overall is amazing. I love to play it. But, my biggest problem is that my friend has an android and I have an iPhone, and when we tried to become friends on the game, we cannot because of our different devices. I’d really appreciate it and others would too if you could change that so we all could be friends on all different devices and platforms. Please consider my problem.
US	3	2019-07-23	4.6.1	Cory6pigS	Awesome, Except For...	"Game is beautiful and so much fun! I love the diversity in dragon types and character of each. I have been playing this everyday which is rare for me. I like that your dragons earn gold even when you are not playing; it’s a nice little bonus. 
A couple things: the game is heavy on trying to get you to buy extras. I have been able to bypass all of it and still enjoy the game, but it seems like every time I get on they keep shoving these bundle sales in my face. Another thing is the ads. They are pretty frequent with some popping up in the middle of doing something. Talk about a buzzkill. DragonML is my temporary escape from all the marketing crap we are force fed everyday; I sure as hell don’t want it in my game!
I will still keep playing because so far this game has kept me engaged (for now). It’s just hard to find those games for me, and even harder to find games without ads that are free and non-subscription based."

US	5	2019-07-22	4.6.1	Harrytheboy	Please read this developer(s)	I think this game needs changes. I mean, don’t get me wrong, this is a great game. It just has room for improvement. First, there are way too many ads. Every second an ad pops in my face (exaggeration). Second, I would really like there to be a way to sell unhatched dragons. It is INCREDIBLY BORING waiting for a unwanted dragon to hatch. Third, add more dragons into the game. I already have most of the dragons and it is really hard to get the rest of the dragons. Anyways that is it.  This is a good game. I wish you luck on the game.🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
US	1	2019-07-22	4.6.1	8.0.3.	Is this a joke?	First of all, this is what you call a “Buy to win” game. I don’t have the money to buy gems just to open chests and get the same pieces from an event (time rift etc). I wasted my money on a wasted game. You could of done a LOT better, but you ignored the opportunity. I am very disappointed in the developers and the creator of this. “Why?” You May ask. I have so many reasons I could go on forever. It is plain unreasonable to add so many legendary/divine dragons. It makes me bored of them, I don’t understand their purpose if there’s so many of them. Getting food is a whole different matter. I have to pay millions of coins, what over a day, just for some short lasting food?! This is unrealistic and boring. Feeding dragons is also annoying. I have to use thousands of ‘fruit’ in order to feed my strongest dragons, and then I have to plant food all over again just to repeat this. I do not agree to the functions of this so-called “game”. Fix this for the sake of your game. Or don’t, and make many suffer.
US	4	2019-07-21	4.6.1	Lindy Lou 1959	7/21/19	"I hate to say I have downgraded my ranking of the game to a 3.  It is too much to have 3 events going on a the same time.  Not only having 3 things going at a time the wait time in the events like Furry Feathers is absolutely ridiculous.  You collect one item with a wait time of up to an hour.  Your should never have a wait without being able to collect up to 5 items.  One item and then a wait time is totally annoying.  This was my #1 game but has dropped to about #3 or #4.  

I gave Dragon Mania a 3 based on the new update.  The new dragons are a nice touch but hope they are breedable.  By looking at the book of dragons last night it looks like they are all LTD.  I like the fact of a new breeding den which is something we have asked for a very long time.  The fact that it is $4.99 a month stinks.  All the other games have it as an item you purchase with gems or game cash.  The slots in the dragon storage facility are out way to high, really $100M for one slot is utterly ridiculous.  I play your game more than the rest but it looks like you guys are starting to be a money game like the other ones.  I will not purchase the extra breeding den for $4.99 a month due to reasons stated above.  Very disappointed to see the game headed as purchasing game and ruin a fun game for many."

But one of my downs is that they let the other team have to Times to hit than me. It’s so hard to win when they get more turns. Other thing is that to bread a dragon takes so long. After all I still rate this a solid 4 stars.

US	5	2019-07-11	4.6.1	Felinis😺	Super fun and addictive!	This game involves managing space and currency, as well as the obvious theme of dragons. Several aspects that I really enjoy are the incubation period for eggs, the ability to breed two dragons to get an entirely new one, and the farming for food to level up your dragons, though the former and latter can be a tad tedious. Overall, this is a really fun game, and I totally recommend it.

US	1	2019-07-11	4.6.1	Awesome star some	Ads ads ADSSSS	Nope. No no no. This game is just messed up. The same stupid drug ad pops up on my screen every time I entered the game. But that’s not the “real problem” it’s only part of it. There is a small “X” at the top but I can’t exit the ad and I close the game and re-open it just to see the same ad. I don’t even open it for a second and that ad is there. I can’t seem to make it go away. I can’t play my game due to this ad. I have no clue why there are stupid drug ads on a game like this anyway. It’s ruining the way I play. I use to have no problem but there are too many ads. Ide never thought I give it a one star and it will never go to three or higher until those ads are slowed down or stopped. I don’t know if the ads are the games fault or the creators fault but it’s ruining my game experience. I’m being serious. I literally can’t play my game with ad. I’ve made it way too far to quit my game. Do what ever you can to fix. I can’t dare delete the progress I made. It’s too much time. I can’t do any events. I can’t earn gems. I can’t breed. I basically can’t do anything. Plz do something about the ads. I might reconsider the rating. ❤️ I love the game but not the ads
US	5	2019-07-11	4.6.1	stephenbhadran	My favorite of Dragon ML	My favorite of this game is all the battles,dragons,and many more stuff including the dragon fury I wonder if you guys can add the chat but only level 15 players can do that and I like a lot of dragons I started playing when I was young and I liked a lot of cool dragons and I wonder if you could make a movie rated pg for frentic/intense sequences of action violence,language and some rude humor & that is my title of My favorite of Dragon ML.

US	5	2019-07-11	4.6.1	purplelavender26	I like dragon mania but...	I love DragonML it’s really cool. You get to play around with dragons feed them. And some them are really cute! But my only problem is how long it takes sometimes to do stuff like it’s long like really long more then 24 hours. I get it I know that’s how the game works but sometimes people have work/school so they don’t time to check. I know you have notifications but you sometimes put your device on silence. And I know you can also check back and stuff but that’s only if you play the game like every weekend. I mean in real life it takes forever to get some stuff you hatch. I don’t about breeding if it takes long in real life but  I think you should have to spend gems on breeding your dragon. Overall tho I LOVE the game it’s super cool and how you get to train your dragon. Thanks for giving us this great game! I hope you take my advice. Thank you good bye!!

All the dragons are unique, interesting and animated in cute, weird little ways. You can pet them, train them, teach them, and other cool stuff. Leveling up is fair, habitats and gems are fair, getting legendary dragons isn’t impossible, and the ads are existent but not annoying. My favorite thing about this game is battling. It is by far the most in-depth yet simple system I have every seen, and requires a lot of easy-to-learn strategy. Overall it is a personal, always-challenging yet easy-going game that keeps making you want to come back for more.
US	1	2019-07-10	4.6.1	PierresBunBun	Boring	I’m starting to get bored. There isn’t no new elements. I want some new base elements.
US	5	2019-07-10	4.6.1	PandaJana	Awesome🤩🤩	I’ve been playing this game on and of since it was released and I LOVE this game I have no complaints. This game is constantly giving u awesome and cool things to do.if there is two things I could change it would be making friending easier and being able to play the same account on multiple devices.

US	5	2019-07-10	4.6.1	djinn-jenn	Love this game!	But I can’t get the cloud to move from the latest dungeon, and now I can’t access any of the rest of the game either. I tried using app support, but the page is blank for me right now. I wanna play my dragon game!
US	4	2019-07-10	4.6.1	hmschlmom79	Good game but...	I was really in to it at first but over time it really just became a “collect your coins, food and play another game.

US	3	2019-07-09	4.6.1	Broccli ark	A Whole new island has appeared!	Horrible idea that ruined the game! Not a island but a huge region of massive electricity that made me burn inside, still can feel it in the application store, What in the world are they thinking? Trying to create a 3rd world war!
US	5	2019-07-09	4.6.1	CUZ ONICA	BEST GAME EVER	This is the best game ever. I would not change a thing except shorten the time in between the enchant chests. Other wise this is the most fun I've ever had playing and my sister loves it too
US	5	2019-07-09	4.6.1	iytx i	Yay	I love this game so much still a little confused on the controls but overall it’s a really good game
US	1	2019-07-09	4.6.1	Cear_76	Updates mess up my phone!	"FIX THE APP, I LOVE THE GAME BUT IT MESSING UO MY PHONE IS A BIG PROBLEM 

Every time they send out an update, it causes my phone to start turning on and off, and it won’t stay on! I still have not gotten a response or a fix from the last update about 2 weeks ago.

I end up having to reset my phone. This time it worked for about an hour and then started to do the same thing again!!!!!!"
US	4	2019-07-09	4.6.1	Ambrosethethird	Great game, just one issue.	I loved this game! The colors and the creative dragons were amazing, but I have a complaint about the number of habitats we get, I don’t think the players get enough habitats. Countless times I’ve had to stop the game to level up in order to hatch a dragon egg. It’s really frustrating.
US	5	2019-07-09	4.6.1	everyothernicknameistakenyup	Amazing game	This wondrous app is perfect for anyone who has a fondness for dragons, breeding, and fun in general. Definitely a good time burner!
US	5	2019-07-09	4.6.1	TigerGirl:)	My favorite game	I love this game, it’s my favorite. It has everything, raising, fighting, designing, ect.

US	5	2019-07-09	4.6.1	attack the light	GREAT GAME 🤩🤩🤩	"I given this app 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ because its the first game i ever loved.every time i come from school there’s something to do like collecting coins ,feeding and taking care of dragons.there are lots of updates event and new dragons.i also love the idea of having a battlefield ,arena and a dungeon.

But you could make just about little changes.you could introduce us to new islands and elements."
US	3	2019-07-09	4.6.1	dr mcrazzy	Fun game	I really like the game and have play several years. I have spent a lot of time and money leveling up dragons to the max level, which at this time is 100. I think it is wrong that in the dungeon, your dragons are level 117,118 which has made it impossible to conquer
US	5	2019-07-09	4.6.1	Elsa&annafrozen	I love it!! But a little changes	"I absolutely love this game its so fun and addicting! But the couple things i would request is... 1.Easier to get more amounts of food without spending 200k.
2.A way to save progress with out a facebook account so you can transfer it to another device.
3.The prices and time it takes on things just seems a little too much.
Besides that the game is amazing!!"
US	5	2019-07-09	4.6.0	Kara_18472	Good game	Fun game cool dragons!
US	1	2019-07-08	4.6.0	from Axandre	This game stinks	I used to enjoy this game but it got to boring
US	5	2019-07-08	4.6.0	bookworm/ipadworm	Probably the best game on my ipad	"I have exactly 152 games on my ipad (i counted) and there are only a couple that i actually play, one of them being dragon ML. i  pretty much only play my singing monsters, hey day, minion rush, stupendo, cooking fever, clash royale dumb ways to die, my talking tom 2, monster legends and, DRAGON MANIA LEGENDS out of the 152 games i have. I have 3 dragon games on my ipad and the only one i play is dragon ML. If you just wanna hear what i have to say about DML, skip the next two paragraphs. If you wanna read about how i compare DML to other dragon games, read on...

1. Dragon story) 
Dragon story is an extremely cute game that is extremely hard to play. The graphics are cute, but the animations are horrible (like when a dragon reaches the end of its habitat, instead of turning around in 3d, its picture just flips),and there are TOO MANY things to do. I have been playing dragon story for nearly 3 years, and im still stuck on level 6 because i just cant seem to understand the game. 

2. Dragon city)
I read a review that said that the person liked dragon city more that DML, but I completely disagree. The animations are the same as dragon story, but the graphics are (in my opinion) extremely ugly, especially the faces 😑 🤮. And dragon city is also pretty hard to understand.

3. Dragon ML 😁 🎉) 
DML has probably the best graphics and animations ive ever seen. The animations are advanced (no flipping pics, actual turning dragons and amazing movement in the dragons), and the pics of the dragons are extremely cute and realistic. Its not to hard to understand how to play either (place a building, harvest food, pet, feed, train, and battle with dragons, battle in the arena and level up, breed, hatch, etc.). Maybe one of the best parts of DML is that you can recruit a friend with just a code, NO FACEBOOK, which is awesome for people who live in countries where facebook is filtered (like me), so i could recruit my aunt (yay!) 

Overall, DML is an amazing game, probably the best i have EVER seen. I would totally recommend this game to younger gamers (it took my aunt a while to figure out how to play 😂). I would also like to thank people who took the time. To read (maybe) the longest review ive ever wrote for the best game ever made 😝.
I ❤️ DML"

US	4	2019-07-06	4.6.0	boutchiquette19	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!!	You should totally download this game! I have been playing this game for 2 years and it is so fun!Their are so many dragons to collect, buuuuuuttttttttttttt.................. their is one thing that I would like to fix, It would be good if you could un-enchant dragons, because one day I enchanted a dragon and then I regretted my action and wanted to fix it but I couldn’t. Well other than that, this game is fun and cool you should totally buy it!And thank you for reading this! I am adding on to the report I did a few months ago. And I want you to Know that the newest update you did very stupid. 1. It takes away the old dungeon that was kind of fun. 2. It says the knew dungeon you gave us is always in “construction” ( it’s been like that for a week now) 3.How do you even get the things you need to buy the new Islands and the new 🐉 4. You can’t play in the dumb dungeon anymore. Please fix the new update and make the game better please!
US	5	2019-07-05	4.6.0	Gxhshajzvaishxvsbjdbw	Best dragon adventure! 🐉🐲	I have an idea! You can do an update that you can work with your friends to win battles! And a 2 in Spanish battle like 2p v 2p and this is a great DragonML adventure! So many dragons so many choices so many adventures!i bet you can make DragonML more than a adventure, I’m counting on you!

US	5	2019-07-05	4.6.0	Dr.Pepper Pig	Great game but...	It’s a good game but I think it should be easier to get gems,Dragons.etc. I would like the breeding time to also be cut down and maybe add Clan fights. Clan fights are where people in the same clan or a different clan fight and the winner gets a reward. Overall it’s a great game and I suggest it to all my friends
US	5	2019-07-04	4.6.0	kbcnhthm	DragonManiaLegends	It is a fun game where you have to battle against other people and it’s so much fun because Toby is my closest friend now on DragonManiaLegends

US	4	2019-07-04	4.6.0	Jill packer	I absolutely love this game but...	As of recently there’s these interactive adds like this bean boozled ad that won’t really let you X out of it until you play along with it... and it pops up constantly... which is quite annoying. Second of all, on the battle map or whatever it’s called, I wish you could control how many energy thingies you can use so you don't automatically have to refuel the entire number of battles you can do if that makes sense. Oh and I wish when you are trying to watch ads in order to receive benefits like gems the ads would actually load.
US	2	2019-07-04	4.6.0	Starting to give up	Something went wrong	I’ve played this game for a few years now and recently it has been crashing a lot. Every time I finish a fight it crashes before I can collect the rewards. It also crashes when I’m trying to start cave searches. Very frustrating trying to play the game and you have to keep opening the app.

US	1	2019-07-03	4.6.0	Elizabethj795	Meh.	"It’s really fun at first but by the end of your first month, your bored out of your mind. All you end up doing is waiting days for food so you can breed two dragons for days on end, so you can get and egg that quite literally either takes days to hatch or is worthless. It’s a really crappy boring game. You need to add more action or at least some excitement. Like, yawn. 😑. It needs to make me think, “I must save my dragon from the evil villain or he will die!” That kind of stuff. You know? It needs to keep you on your toes! 
It’s an ok game. It just needs more action.

Thank you."

US	5	2019-07-03	4.6.0	K Mew	Amazing game, can’t put it down	This game has the best parts of every dragon game I’ve ever played. You breed and have dragons, collect gold, but also fight other dragons the Vikings own to protect your islands. You have an amazing battle team, and can have an awesome clan later in the game. You upgrade habitats to get more money and have more dragons. In other words, this is the best game I have ever played. 😍🐉
US	5	2019-07-03	4.6.0	Nico8237	Best game ever couldn’t ask for a better game!!!	Sooooooooooo GOOD
US	4	2019-07-03	4.6.0	Wolfi360	P͙l͙e͙a͙s͙e͙ r͙e͙a͙d͙	OK, so the graphics are amazing!! SO realistic and good looking. Scroll rate is awesome, and there is no glitch. I like the way you tickle the dragon for coins and the way you battle-- non- arena style. But,here are the problems. So so many ads. Also, there are too many VIP and extra purchase problems. I'm not spending 100$ on a couple thousand GE,s, one dragon and a habitat! COME ON!!!! Otherwise, it's a great game! Please fix prices and ad problems, though.
US	5	2019-07-03	4.6.0	uhiighjkhvjhbvfakdjbcjoh	The best game ever	This is the best game in the world, because you could breed them
US	4	2019-07-02	4.6.0	OMGNEHBEYUBDYUBDYUB	Gems and ads (Please read!)	I have been playing this game since I was little, and I LOVE this game! It is so active and fun to play!❤️❤️~ But there’s a TONS of bad problems!! Hours to wait: The gems are too much! You have to wait hours and hours (even a whole day!)just to make the egg hatch! It’s never short, other games: 20 minutes! This game: 16 hours 😭💔 And I don’t have that much gems to even make it hatch immediately!! And since it’s hours I’m always making another egg and when dragons are done breeding I have to wait for hours for another egg to hatch! So I have to stop playing the game until it’s done!! Unbelievable game!! Annoying ads: There’s just too many ads. There’s ads 20 seconds long when you enter the game, ads when you get food, ads when you tap on a habitat and when you get out of the habitat, ads when I shop, ads when I buy foods ads when I touch dragons and even try to feed them!!! And it is THE SAME AD! THERES SO MANY ADS EVERY TIME I PLAY!! ITS THE SAME AD AND IT KEEPS WANTING ME TO BUY STUFF EVERY TIME! I CANNOT PLAY BECAUSE EVERY SECOND AN AD POPS UP!! Oh my gosh!!!

US	5	2019-07-02	4.6.0	LovelyPrettyKitty100	The Best Game EVER	This game is my absolute favorite I’ve been playing it for about a year now sometimes when I am battling my dragons against other dragons I feel like a proud mother. One suggestion I think you should allow the dragon names to be longer cause I just love naming my dragons but the names I want are longer than they should be. But the game is amazing tho.
US	5	2019-07-02	4.6.0	Jojo-1704	Dragon mania is the best	This game is so amazing it keep you occupied and right when you say I will get off you will remember something and you can’t resist to play it and when you breed dragons you can’t wait to see what it is and the incitement is great and you just want you dragons to be great

US	5	2019-07-02	4.6.0	xXMiamiMamaXx	Ah, nostalgia.	I had this game installed on my iPad a couple years ago. I loved it, and I played it almost everyday. I eventually got tired of being stuck on this one level and deleted it. I reinstalled the app on my phone a couple years later (around a month ago) and was finally able to beat that level! Great game, creative dragons, and overall an amazing way to pass time!
US	3	2019-07-02	4.6.0	CR0723	To many adds besides that cool game.	I like the game but the adds need to be removed cause it seems like it’s a couple of seconds before I get that same add.

US	5	2019-07-02	4.6.0	CactusWolf Gaming	AMAZING GAME	This is my favorite game ever! I used to play on my mom’s iPad, but then I stopped playing for a while. Eventually I forgot about it. Then I got an iPad and remembered it. So I downloaded it again, and I still love it! If you could make it to where players can vs each other, that would make the game even better! Also, could you please make it to where you can go on a first person adventure with your dragons? You could loot chests, dungeons, and conquer bosses! Sometimes, you can fight dragons and you will rarely be able to tame them. To tame them, you have to beat them.
US	5	2019-07-02	4.6.0	miagehtti	I LOVE THIS GAME!!	When I started playing this game it was on my dads iPad it was downloaded originally when he got it. I played it because I saw a add about it but when I continued playing it felt more than the add it was amaze balls! When I came home from the doctor I asked my mom if I could download it. When she said yes I was OVERJOYED I also downloaded this app called dragon city but it was not as good. When I started playing dragon mania on MY iPad my sister was watching and got interested too. She downloaded both the apps and now we still agree dragon mania is our favorite. I played for SOOOOOO long my BFF started getting addicted to it then her cousin then her cousins BFF. We all play together now and I love it. But I always go short on gems. I wish we could pay coins for it not real money cause my parents won’t let me. I still love the game though I think the others that don’t have the game should try it
US	4	2019-07-02	4.5.6	ccnbeaufort	Epiccccc	Fun,entertaining,keeps me busy it's a really fun game were u can raise and breed your own dragons level them up and do battles!
US	4	2019-07-01	4.5.6	Andrés Vera	I like this game but It’s not completely perfect	I like this game but why do you have to use so much gems? u need to use 2 gems for 1 minute isn’t that a little too much? A good thing about this game is the graphics i think the graphics are great.
US	5	2019-07-01	4.5.6	unacorn qween	First dragon game	First it was easy than harder harder than imposable  after 10 day I’m in level 8 still.but I like we start with a lot of diamonds other than the other game I play starts with nothing but free dragon.
US	5	2019-06-30	4.5.6	Cristiano Logrippo	One in a Million	This game is so addictive and is so much fun! It is so easy to get amazing and strong dragons so fast in the game. There is always some event happening. I jut barley started and I got an amazingly strong dragon! It is also amazing because you can earn one day VIP. Even if you don’t have VIP you can still do everything, VIP only makes it so you get more money and that stuff nothing like VIP only area. I just barely started this game and I already wake up in the morning and play it. It’s an amazing game were you only have to go on every so often because your plants will grow, your eggs will hatch, and you building will get built even when you are not on.I am in love with this game, it has something that the other games like this don’t have.
US	5	2019-06-30	4.5.6	🐊dragon born🦎	Great but..	Well, this game is really well done but just one tiny problem. The prices for dragon’s are a lil too high and cost for vip is also high. Like 45 gems for 2 day vip. The cost to buy gems and coins is a bit too high also but otherwise I love it! Keep up the great work!
US	3	2019-06-30	4.5.6	Bunk2105	Way too many adverts!	The game itself is great. Decent graphics are accompanied by good gameplay; however, the adverts really take away from the whole game. On the phone, ads are played at least every minute. Most of the time you accidentally click on it because it comes out of nowhere. Or. A video plays and when you try to hit the X button, it doesn’t work. Just fix the ads and the game would be a lot better.
US	5	2019-06-30	4.5.6	GlowBow	One of my favorites😻	This game is so fun, the higher u go the more you can get in rewards and dragons, etc. The only conflict I have, would be to make it a lil easier to enchant the dragons, I have so many materials but I don’t have the ones I need to enchant my dragons past level 2 or 3 stars. Please give out more enchanted freebies that you will need for leveling up even further.

US	5	2019-06-29	4.5.6	your mom lezbo	Love it	So fun and cool and hardcore I love it y’all should download now
US	4	2019-06-29	4.5.6	michey✌️	😅	Eh, it’s a good Game, but they make everything so confusing
US	2	2019-06-28	4.5.6	luverdrag56	Hatchery	I don’t think you should have to wait up to 20 hours just to hatch an egg and it shouldn’t be over 100 diamonds just to upgrade it
US	5	2019-06-28	4.5.6	chy chy14	Best game ever	I’ve had this game for about 4 1/2 years. This is my favorite game there is no flaws it’s perfectly designed! You get gems by collecting dragons so there’s really no need to speed money unless you want to. Anyway this is a 5 star game and I’m happy to have been with it while it’s grown. If you don't agree I’m sorry.
US	5	2019-06-28	4.5.6	scarcrow12345	Amazing game!!!	But some times it does not save your game it restarts everything............... or save some.
US	5	2019-06-28	4.5.6	Puppylove1820	Nice	I love this game a lot 🥰
US	5	2019-06-28	4.5.6	defaultyboi123	Excellent but needs a few things to add	"I think that this game is adorable addictive and fun to play however I think you developers should definitely add more parts to the game especially the battle aspect armor would be a great addition so would unlocking skills like the fire drag levels a skill up to inferno blast or something like that would be a nice addition also...if it’s not too much some new new dragons that don’t look like someone threw into a house and everything that was in there got stuck to it like maybe a sky dragon a few animal dragons but I’ll quit bugging you guys so yeah

Sincerely, an anonymous user"
US	5	2019-06-27	4.5.6	✨Jadeyy	A great app!	I started this game yesterday and I’m enjoying it so far, There are some things that may cost a little bit much money and a few other problems but I recommend this.

US	3	2019-06-26	4.5.6	Atrieye	Great game! however...	Dragon Mania Legends is a fun and excellent way to pass the time... once per day on some core features. This game has a lot of amazing quality dragons to collect, breed, and even fight. However, certain aspects of the game take enormous amounts of time to pass for certain events to occur. An example would be trying to breed a legendary monthly dragon. The monthly dragon is very rare, however, the other dragons you might get could take five to half a day to hatch. A way to avoid this is to get multiple spots for hatching, however it’s locked behind gems which cost money. This is one example of many, and it can become highly infuriating and tedious for players who cannot buy gems. But if you have random and spaced out intervals of your day that you can occasionally check your phone, then this game’s great.
US	4	2019-06-26	4.5.6	Um,Hi,Peeps	So so so addicting	"This is a great game! It is very addicting and way better than Monster Legends and Dragon City! (No offense ML fans and DC    fans)! But there is a couple problems I would like to mention that would help you really think about it before downloading the game. It is hard to get friends. So when you start the the game you already have 1 friend named Toby. But say if you and ur best friend both play the game, it would be very very hard to become friends. Very addicting. This can be a good thing or a bad thing. If you don't like very addicting games, then this isn't the game for you. I'm on this most of the day trying to level up, save up my gems, harvest food, feed the dragons, battle, get friends, breed, etc. GEMS. So hard to get gems! It is almost impossible to have gems without making in app purchases. 
Also, the wait times for hatching eggs, breeding, food, building and upgrading are WAY TOO LONG!!!! Please try to fix those problems.
Overall, this game in my opinion is worth getting!!! 😊😊"
US	5	2019-06-26	4.5.6	awesome panda21	Good!	Fun game great for most ages but takes some skill to learn everything and the ads on the screens are very excessive and you can barely get to things without hitting one overall great fun game
US	5	2019-06-26	4.5.6	Somephone12345	I love the cute dragons!❤️❤️❤️	When I saw this game, I was like, oh wow these dragons are sooo cute! I looked at how you could breed dragons, collect dragons, and hatch them,etc. so I got the game. And it is sooo awesome! I like how you can level up your dragons, feed them, oh yeah, and if you tickle them they give you gold! It is literally the only game I play on my iPad. But...I really wish it was easier to get gems! And I wish like hatching dragons food farming and breeding did not take over like two days! Love the app, overall!

But I really wish I could change my name to a name I want, as soon as I had the game I would not let me change my name, I know I probably accidentally tapped to quick but I wish that we could change our names mid game. So I urge you to please address this matter whenever you can.

US	5	2019-06-21	4.5.6	Pepsi the Death Rooster	So so cuute! 😍	It is a really fun game that is so worth downloading. The dragons are all so adorable and the graphics are amazing. My complaints are that it gets to a point where it is hard to get enough food to level your dragons and it really stinks when there is an event dragon you really want and you don’t win it. But it is so worth playing so if you are reading this review download dragon mainia legends now. Go!

US	5	2019-06-19	4.5.6	sweetnpink	I need help	Ok so recently I have been DML not connected to Game Center but you know in the game there is an option to connect it and I have always said no. I got pretty far in that game(lvl 40) and I accidentally pressed yes and I lost all of my stuff and got connected to a different account how do I fix.
US	4	2019-06-18	4.5.6	Etographer	Can I restart?	I have played this a while back. For whatever reason though I had moved on from the game and started playing others. However recently I re-downloaded the game to find that there is already lots of data on it and I cannot remember most of it. From what I remember it is a really fun game however I wish it could be a little easier to restart. Can anyone help me restart the game?
US	4	2019-06-18	4.5.6	Mythlee2222	Awesome game but needs work	I Used to play this game a while ago and it’s been changing a lot and all the updates are great except the enchanted league gets a lot harder because you have to fight a lot of players who have higher level dragons but other than that I think the game is great
US	5	2019-06-18	4.5.6	AwsomeH2006	Super fun game	I really like DragonML because it’s one of those games you can’t wait to play every day even though you have had it for a long time. I like how all dragons cost the same to feed, and it’s not the cooler the more feed. The game is awesome to play, and I like the challenges it provides in battles. I also like how dragons are put in a set to complete, and it shows the percentage of players who have completed the set. One thing though is that maybe on very long wait times you could ask if a five minute video or something is played to fully speed up the wait time. I love this game a lot and I think it is better than any other make your own dragon society game. I would prefer it over the How to Train Your Dragon one.Download it because it’s a great game, and don’t listen to the bad reviews!
US	4	2019-06-18	4.5.6	Redia_Fairflare	Pretty good	Nice graphics, fun gameplay and overall a good game. Just wish you could change the names of your dragons.

US	4	2019-06-16	4.5.6	loverofawesomegames	I have an ENORMOUS problem.	"This game is great, HOWEVER I have a ENORMOUS problem.
Whenever I go into the store, (to buy metal dragon & habitat) it says I have 14 of 14 metal habitats. Just the habitat. I can understand with the fire, water, and wind habitats, but metal? Nope.
I don’t even HAVE a single one of those! I’ve looked in my inventory, but a single metal habitat? No! So I can’t breed any cool dragons because I can’t have a metal dragon. Major problem. Overall I would give this game ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ five stars but I have a big problem. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
                                          Please fix."

US	5	2019-06-16	4.5.6	🛐🛐♋️	The game	You need to bring down prices in food so your dragons are healthy snd the other  islands should be a little bit less expensive. It takes a every long time to earn another money to buy a island  but is worth the game. This is my favorite game. Please corn down on prices for dragons. Thanks 😊
US	4	2019-06-16	4.5.6	Aveline.	Great but there is a bug	"The game is beautiful, I have been playing for a couple of months and I love it!

Recently I got a bug when I was buying habitats. All the habitats in the shop said that I had the maximum number built, even if I haven’t even bought that kind of habitat before. It’s really ‘bugging’ me (bu dum chhh) because I need to buy more habitats because I am getting more dragons. Can you fix it?"

US	4	2019-06-15	4.5.6	Lil' Nobody	Good game, but I’ve got a problem	"So in the recent event where the player is to collect ‘Dorbs’ and spend them to play a game where you give certain objects to waiting dragons to earn (sorry I don’t know what they’re called) this icon with a happy dragon on it. The prize, if you’re in the top three on the leaderboard, was the Toy Dragon. I happened to be in second place the last night of the challenge, went to bed, and when I woke up I didn’t get the Toy Dragon. In fact, I didn’t get any reward for being so high up in the leaderboard. 
I’m not really sure what anyone can do about this but maybe there’s a solution
Thanks for reading :)"
US	5	2019-06-14	4.5.6	Pamulahd	My Review and Ideas	Okay I think this is a great game but a lot of stuff needs improving. A. I was wondering if you could make an option to restart? Just a suggestion, but I recently re-downloaded and wanted to restart... B. The ads come at random. Maybe it could give a warning like, “ad coming in...” and tell us when to like stop so we don’t accidentally tap on the screen. This has happened to me about 28 times (and counting) and I’m just sort of tired of it. And C. Could you please make something so you can download all ‘additional resources’ at once? Okay, thanks. I just wanted to tell you guys my opinions and his doesn’t have to happen but I would be really glad if it did.

I got it about a day ago and have been playing it non-stop since, but I’ve noticed that the games is LOADED with advertisements. Now I understand that the developer(s) need to gain money since it is a free game, but the amount of ads that pop out of nowhere and ruin the immersion really bothers me. Other than that, the game is great and the animations are adorable.

US	5	2019-06-09	4.5.6	Floof_The_Review	Ads	"I personally give stars because this is the one flaw I have with this game. Ads. About every five minutes I get the same ad every time, I mean at least have different ads. It really gets on my nerves because I feel the game and developers should know that if you decline an ad, don’t send it back to them multiple times a day. I know it’s hard to make a game, but if you put in a tad bit more effort, this review wouldn’t exist. My point is, try to use ads for other games or don’t have them so often. I’m starting to not like Lunchables because of how much they were advertised to me, but I got Idle Heroes from advertisements from other games.

But besides all that, you’ve done an amazing job creating an interesting and fun game for people of all ages to play!"

US	5	2019-06-07	4.5.6	htjfeybfyjkgrhk.	Best game ever	First of all, I see why it’s rating is high. This game is amazing because you can explore dungeons with your epic dragons. You can also battle, and expand your land, in a epic game. Plus there are hundreds of dragons to, and to discover. And you can train dragons, and inchant your dragons to make them stronger. I would say this is better than Fortnite. All I have to say is great job game loft.
US	5	2019-06-07	4.5.6	Zookepperdino	Amazing but a few things are missing.	"I love this game so much! I really enjoy the Zodiac Release, however, there are somethings I would like to see. 
  First, I think there could be a few new elements and rankings like Radiant ( ranking ) and/or Ore ( element ). I think adding something like this would improve the game so that more people would like to play.
  Second, maybe try adding an MPC at lvl. 60 or something to help you grow food x1 1/2 times faster or like having an MPC that can help you train your Dragons.
 I really hope you consider this, I would love if you add this!"
US	5	2019-06-07	4.5.6	DRAGON MANIA IS AWESOME!!	Habitat Problems :<	This is an awesome game, congrats, but there is a bug I would very much enjoy you fix. I have 3 water habitats and I go into my storage to get another one, but it says maximum number reached: 39/39 habitats placed. And I try to get a fire habitat, same thing. The only way I know to get rid of it is delete a habitat. But that is really very annoying to do every time I get on dragon mania. I have about 6 friends who are having the same problem, and I bet some people here can relate too. Please fix this. But overall this is an awesome game!! Please hurry, because I have a Submarine Dragon ready to be placed!! Thanks!

US	4	2019-06-06	4.5.6	bhvkfxudkjbg	It’s very addictive, but...	I love this game. Most dragon games, you just feed and fight. In this game, you can interact with your dragons. There is one thing I wish was better. The space in your island is very limited. If there was more space, that would be awesome. Or if the other islands were easier to get. I would totally suggest this game, tho
US	5	2019-06-06	4.5.6	Sempie lover	Great app	I am addicted!😍
US	5	2019-06-05	4.5.6	averydaverydockerydoo🙃🙃🙃	This game is AMAZING!!!!🥳🥳🥳	I love this game so much, I moved it to its own new page! For starters, the game has amazing graphics! It also is very fun to play. You can farm your dragons food, breed dragons, and battle your dragons with other dragon players online! You’ll find yourself head over heals INLOVE with this game. You can also compare your dragons with other dragon players! This is so much fun, and if you have a big group of friends (I do) get them all to download the game. You can have mini contests, like “Who can breed this dragon first?”, “who has more gold?” Etc. If your not already convinced to download this game you clearly did not get the right education growing up. 🙂
US	5	2019-06-05	4.5.6	Awesome Girl Kiki	So Fun!	I am addicted... not too much, that would be bad. But this is a very fun game. I like it! One downside, it’s laggy sometimes.

US	5	2019-06-04	4.5.6	Ikra-Playz	I love this game!	I absolutely love this game! I normally don’t get attached to many games at all or more/longer then this one. It has variety of dragons and the designs are really awesome as well. I’ve grown to love them and honestly more like attached. I love that it’s not just a regular type match up kind of combat and that it has different paths at the end to suit what ever battle style you choose(or what other dragons in your attack party is). In all, I love the game!
US	5	2019-06-03	4.5.6	Funny🎃😼🤖	LOVE IT!!!!!!	This game is one of the best!!! You should really get this game love the new updates since you now can earn great dragons for so little time I got the fireball dragon in less than 10 minutes!!!!! AMAZING GAME

I have been playing this game for 2 years and it is so fun!Their are so many dragons to collect, buuuuuuttttttttttttt.................. their is one thing that I would like to fix, It would be good if you could un-enchant dragons, because one day I enchanted a dragon and then I regretted my action and wanted to fix it but I couldn’t. Well other than that, this game is fun and cool you should totally buy it!And thank you for reading this!

US	1	2019-06-01	4.5.6	nana Rose Tine-komat	Uhhhhhh	Dragon mania should be for four and up because now I can’t download it because it’s for 12-year-olds and there shouldn’t be a limit to how many times you can battle also it should be easier to get gems I’m like I only have nine and it has so much stuff that you need gems for
US	5	2019-06-01	4.5.6	Eva1971	Love this game!	This is one of my favorite games to play. You might have to spend money on some cool things but to me it’s worth it! I’ve been playing it for about 3 years now
US	5	2019-06-01	4.5.6	helloidkkkkikk	Cool	I like it
US	4	2019-06-01	4.5.6	puff mike	Great just one thing though	I love the game overall but the prices of gems need to be lower because you can’t get that much gems they are RARE that is the only reason why you should change the game
US	4	2019-06-01	4.5.6	mega epic boi	Too many commercials	TOO MANY COMMERCIALS
US	5	2019-05-31	4.5.6	jimfu-san	Super	This game is super  it was my best game and I got a legendary
US	5	2019-05-31	4.5.6	Ghøsty	Great game!	I love this game! I really like the wide variety of dragons this game has. The islands are cool to.

And you also say this super short but there is a lot of good stuff you will find until you download it 
DragonML d"
US	5	2019-05-31	4.5.6	Tb 123456	Really good but,	all the prices are to high for the amount of gems.It can get tough and to much on your mind but it is still a great and addictive game.
US	5	2019-05-31	4.5.6	DueyCuminer	AMAZING Game but I would like something to change	This game is really awesome but I would like for it to be easier for diamond to get. I had the game for a few years now and it has been amazing but I always have one struggle which was getting diamonds. Half the time I would have to buy some to get the amount I needed. If you wouldn't mind please make diamonds easier to get! It would make this the best game ever!!!
US	3	2019-05-31	4.5.6	Marcio 2019	It's a great game but...	"Adds in the middle of game?
I watch a lot adds to get diamonds and coins. But suddenly adds show up with no reason.
It's to much."
US	5	2019-05-31	4.5.6	AwsomeH2006	Super fun game	I really like DragonML because it’s one of those games you can’t wait to play every day even though you have had it for a long time. I like how all dragons cost the same to feed, and it’s not the cooler the more feed. The game is awesome to play, and I like the challenges it provides in battles. I also like how dragons are put in a set to complete, and it shows the percentage of players who have completed the set. The game is overall really fun and there isn’t much developers would have to change!
US	5	2019-05-31	4.5.6	hyperdragonplayer	Anonymous	This game is so amazing and has great graphics. One more great thing is that this game is fair and is actually possible to beat. I’m so happy I downloaded this game and I hope more people play it.
US	5	2019-05-30	4.5.6	Somephone12345	THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!😁😁😁❤️❤️❤️🦄💕😍	I have been looking for awesome dragon games for ages, and when I saw that this game was five star and had the CUTEST looking dragons ever, I was like “OMG!!!I have to get this!” I don’t think that this AWESOME game has any problems and no glitches at all, so if anyone is reading this, I am just saying...GET THIS GAME!!!
US	2	2019-05-30	4.5.6	skipperismylife	Game too slow	Everything takes forever to finish. Nice concept but game pace is way too slow.
US	5	2019-05-30	4.5.6	dragon mania for life!	I love this game!	Honestly this game is the best. The campaign is soooo long so it never gets boring! Anyways, if your reading this and you don’t have the game give it a try.

US	4	2019-05-28	4.5.5	jesusfollowerj	My favorite game	I’ve played this game for over a year. Has multiple events you can play alone or with other players.  I have more dragons than places to put them.  Global chat was discontinued due to some unsavory people that ruined for rest of us. You can still chat with people in your on clan. Don’t know what a clan is? Join the game to find out🙂. It really is fun. Deducted a star because of too limited # of habitats.
US	5	2019-05-27	4.5.0	Mythlee2222	Great game	This a good game the only thing is that you have to wait a long time for a lot of things
US	5	2019-05-26	4.5.0	WolfyEvolution	A few suggestions!	"Dear GameLoft, I have a few suggestions for your game, Dragon Mania Legends. So let’s get into it!

1. I think we should, if not in the game already, be able to turn eggs into pedestals (reference to Dragonvale).

2. We should be able to create and make clans earlier than level 30. I also have a “problem” due to “recent changes in my country’s clan thing blah blah blah”. Please fix this!

3. I think there should be another land, the Forgotten Isles, where an undiscovered breed of dragon awaits. It might put some spark into the adventure and breeding theme of DML.

4. I would like the upgrade for the hatchery to go level 2: 50 gems, level 3: 100 gems, etc, etc.

5. Can we be able to chat with our clan? My clan is Clanny Clan, shout out to them! Since I see no way in communicating with them, it just seems like clan chat will bring players closer together. 

6. My username is Dragonmaster490535, because I didn’t change my name at the beginning, because I didn’t understand it. Please change my name to Aries The Wolf, exactly how I spelled it here. Thank you if u do!!! =3

THANKS FOR VIEWING! -WolfyEvolution-"
US	4	2019-05-26	4.5.0	arial arts is amazing	Breeding and hatching the eggs	I think that you should speed up the hatching and breeding Process so we can fight more dragons quicker and it’ll be more fun because you can breed more dragons because the hatching place won’t be full and find out what your Dragon’s are that to me would make it more fun

US	5	2019-05-24	4.5.0	tiffany broyal	Game is good but	This game is amazing but it has ads that say stop vaping and some about eating toenails. The sound of the ads are crunching sound and it made me sick. The ads come up about every 2 miuntes and there are no way to remove these ads. Make sure if you get this app the cut down the sound. If I come give this game 0 stars I would.

US	5	2019-05-21	4.5.0	Hvail	Really fun!	I’ve been playing this game for over 3 years now and I still love it!
US	5	2019-05-21	4.5.0	myboybob748	Great game but the only flaw...	This game is a great game. I love how you can do so many things with your dragons. I also love all the events and challenges. I am addicted to this game. The only flaw is the adds. I’m not saying that adds pop up every second, it’s what the adds are about. Most of the adds are saying you shouldn’t smoke and I agree with that, but the adds usually have pictures that you wouldn’t want yourself or your child to see. I have seen some that say “don’t imagine eating a spoon full of toenails” and that just...ug. I don’t need to picture that in my brain. Imagine you are playing the game when all of a sudden a add shows up with a delivery man holding a rotten hand with words above him. Also adds pop up for the game “only one leaves”. Those adds are just creepy! I don’t want to see that! Now, I understand that putting these adds in the game might make the creater money, but could you just change what the adds contain. Over all this is a great game and if you can take stuff like this, you should definitely get this game.
US	4	2019-05-21	4.5.0	3D better	What the.........	So I was playing for a lot of years and then........ I saw all dragons have 2D heads but 3D bodies! Also, the fire dragons and all the others that have a different texture all fly and have feet, but they don't walk ? So what if you make them walk AND fly. Thank you for reading and plz fix this. Overall it's a great game!!!!!!!!! I forgot to add: plz make them all 3D ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Keep making awesome content!

US	4	2019-05-18	4.5.0	Ms. No face	😒	I downloaded this game on a Kindle I used to have and it worked just fine and it started me at the beginning. This time it was like I was playing on somebody else’s account, My dragons were upgraded already. one of my dragons even had one of its elements upgraded, and I tried deleting it but when I went back into it on the App Store, the download button was the download to cloud button. This is ridiculous.
US	5	2019-05-18	4.5.0	MV#33	Best games ever	Hey Game is so good always something to do with dragons Gain coins for you and it’s the it cost no money
US	5	2019-05-18	4.5.0	littie Nat	DragonsML	I love the game It’s amazing I have been playing it sense I was 4 years old I especially loved the new dragons some times I wish to have more land and more dragons and of everything basically I love the game and I wish to have more more upgrades but my phone has little bit of gigabytes so some times i can’t even get on the game! It makes me disappointed and more.
US	5	2019-05-18	4.5.0	jamesjsenecal	Awesome game!	This game is so fun and time consuming. Have a great time breeding! There is always a new dragon to get and always a fun event.
US	5	2019-05-17	4.5.0	A🐁	DragonML	I love DragonML! I’ve seen and tried many dragon games but this is by far the best! I love all the cool things you can do! There’s tons of events that let you earn lots of free stuff! Plus, I got my friends to join and I can send them gifts and reverse! The pictures are kind of realistic and the bunny update was awesome!
US	2	2019-05-17	4.5.0	enfneiejf	Too many ads	Stop having unskippable ads pop up every 30 seconds, gem dragons and vip are already shoved in my face way too much. Also is there not a way to move dragons to different habitats??
US	5	2019-05-17	4.5.0	MhadGhabby	Future updates	This game has an amazing way of making my day a little better and it’s over all great to play, the addition of Direct messaging between friends would be a great way to get to know the people you play with and to be able to thank them for helping you level up and get better at the game.
US	4	2019-05-17	4.5.0	Itsthepersonwhosconfused00	I like it.	There's only one thing, I made a Facebook account and it's not letting me log out of my old account and log in with my Facebook. The option won't appear. Do you know how to fix it?
US	2	2019-05-16	4.5.0	jdjdissbsidn	Omg the Ads!	This game has a lot of potential to be great, but the ads completely ruin it. After pressing almost 3 things, an add pops up. They used to be ones I could X-out, so I wouldn’t mind it too much. But now, it’s whole videos that you can’t even skip! And do you get anything for watching them? NOPE. Extremely irritating! If it doesn’t change, I’m going to uninstall.
US	2	2019-05-16	4.5.0	DarkWing Danny	Too many involuntary ads	"I play on both Mac iOS and Xbox live on a pc. This review is for the iOS version.

Too many involuntary ads. 

I get it, things cost money to make, which is why you have voluntary ads for prizes. Things also cost money, like gems or food.

But if mid play an ad pops up that I can’t get rid of and that I don’t get rewarded for suffering through, it makes me want to stop playing altogether. 

If you don’t spend any money, this game is hard to level your dragons, so vip is worth it on a non iOS version. My pc game I have spent money on and that is the only reason I didn’t 1 star review. With involuntary ads I would give it a 4.

So it makes sense to buy a vip every once in a while because it makes the in game play more enjoyable, but I will never spend money on something that forces ads down my throat as I am just trying to move around the game."
US	2	2019-05-16	4.5.0	Root beer wolf	Review	This game was awesome and in ways it still is, but the ads are ridiculous you don’t even get to play for 5 minutes with out an ad popping up and having to watch the video over and over. Hopefully they see this and take this ad off.
US	5	2019-05-16	4.5.0	YABOIRICARDO	Awesome game	This is the fun game to play because you can get more dragons and upgrade the dragons

US	5	2019-05-15	4.5.0	C for crash	Amazing game	I usually press the no thanks button when a game asks me to rate it but this one game, I just had to.One thing I love about it is that,  it doesn’t just spout out ads all the time.It only does it when you want it to. This game is like what the upgraded version of dragon city, and I think lots of people agree with me.
US	5	2019-05-15	4.5.0	Lovebugme	Keeps telling me no videos ads	It keeps telling me that there is no videos to watch when I try and spin the wheel or get gems for the dragons
US	5	2019-05-15		PierresBunBun	Divine Element and New Elements	Personally I feel you should be able to breed divine dragons like you would any other, and I would like to see more elements, brand new elements in game.
US	5	2019-05-14	4.5.0	skull skeeeez	Question about ads	How is it that a random 5 second ad can pop up at any moment of time during me playing the game yet me actually clicking watch ad to spin the wheel results in an end or retry ad message and the retry never works and how can you have 100% to get a crest in the ruins but not get the crest that doesn’t make any sense
US	1	2019-05-13	4.5.0	VampiressGoddess	Considering deleting	I love this game, but probably will delete it soon. I can handle pop up ads, I can handle 5 second skip ads, but it’s getting to minute + long ads now and I’m not alright with it. Not only is it pay to win, but now I can’t play the game without having to watch 10-15 minutes of ads for every hour of gameplay? No thank you.
US	3	2019-05-13	4.5.0	Ali8ug	Can you please give me the amount of diamonds back?	Hello, I love this game, but when I recently purchased a pack that gives you 200 on the first day and 20 in the next thirty I thought it would be great to buy it. NOPE. I got it about a week ago and has still not received my 20 diamonds a day. I got the 200 but not the 20. Please get back to me on this. Thanks.
US	4	2019-05-12	4.5.0	Nharmonia4ever	Would be more fun without ads	I love this game, but I’m repeatedly shown ads with traumatic images on them. They are for raising awareness for vaping, but they scare me so much that I force quit the app. There are too many apps that only care about money, so those greedy people enable ads and provide no way of permanently removing ads. The love of money is the root of all evil, and scaring people is evil. If you actually cared about the players, you would remove ads. Please remove ads to improve the game!
US	5	2019-05-12	4.5.0	Nina G. :)	Dml please help!	I put the faun dragon to hatch and accidentally sold it! I’m freaking out because I’ll never get snowpelt dragon. Please give me my faun dragon back. It would be so kind! I’m seriously sad about it. I really want snowpelt dragon. Anyways love the game it’s amazing, but please give my faun dragon back!

US	3	2019-05-06	4.5.0	clateyboy	Decent by clayten	Dear creators of this game I have recently played the pixie dot dragon game and I was in second place with no dragon! This is a bunch of crap I have played day and night just to get my very first legendary dragon because it even said places one through three will get the dragon.  Nobody passes me and I did not get a single coin so I demand by this Friday to get the pixie dot dragon in my mail or there will be some problems thank you. Clayten

I think some of the dragons should be the fox dragon, monkey dragon, deer dragon, and the raccoon dragon. Please may you add these dragons to the game please. Even though if these dragons aren’t put on, I will still love this game.

US	3	2019-04-26	4.5.0	Deanna1333	NO WIN WITHOUT MONEY	I’ve been playing this game for 3 years and what started out as a good game has unfortunately gotten worse especially this past year. I’ve watched this game go from fun to stressful. First: you simply cannot win any event without money - a lot of money. The events are at odd times. Ex: fight a particular dragon, gather food and breed dragons and must return in say 35 minutes then next time (in same event) return one hour and a half. I tried doing everything perfectly: completing all tasks to still lose, which is frustrating. You you don’t win anything worthwhile unless you get to top 100. I’ve NEVER WON an event - EVER. Also they’re doing what most games do after a period of time, adding more and more events. They try to tie you to the game via the odd timed events. The only thing I can say NO MONEY NO WIN. I’m discouraged enough to leave the game. The game itself is ok though food and leveling up the dragons are rather unrealistic....it does take a long time. If you want a fairly good but expensive game, play DML, but don’t expect to win unless you pay. Even when you do pay you don’t always win. I wish you good luck.

US	4	2019-04-24	4.5.0	Resla Penn	🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼	"I love love love this game. It takes a while for things to grow, hatch, train, explore etc but it helps me ration out my screen time lol because if not, I would be on it 24/7 because it’s such an addicting game. Cute dragons, nice features and plenty to do in one game. 

The only issue I do have is that now, it will just randomly kick me out of the game. It just started doing that recently. Sometimes I can’t even get into the app. Hopefully that issue will get fixed or I’ll have to unload the app because I can’t play it 😭"

US	5	2019-04-21	4.5.0	WolfyEvolution	A few suggestions!	"Dear GameLoft, I have a few suggestions for your game, Dragon Mania Legends. So let’s get into it!

1. I think we should, if not in the game already, be able to turn eggs into pedestals (reference to Dragonvale).

2. We should be able to create and make clans at level 25. I am level 26 and I really want to create my own clan. Also, if you could make it free to do, that would be great!

3. I think there should be another land, the Forgotten Isles, where an undiscovered breed of dragon awaits. It might put some spark into the adventure and breeding theme of DML.

4. I would like the upgrade for the hatchery to go level 2: 50 gems, level 3: 100 gems, etc, etc.

5. Can we be able to chat with our clan? My clan is the English Canadians, shout out to them! Since I see no way in communicating with them, it just seems like clan chat will bring players closer together. 

THANKS FOR VIEWING! -WolfyEvolution-"

US	5	2019-04-16	4.5.0	El Shof	Awesome Game, but one tiny thing.	Love this game. Reason I gave it five stars is I love the different dragons and seasonly mini games. One thing I don’t like is if you go to the dragon book you can look at the elements on them and with a simple hybrid you can bread the two elements and get that dragon but with bigger types I would get really confused. Over all love the game.
US	5	2019-04-16	4.5.0	nimoore13	Make it so you can watch an ad to speed up hatching process!!	"I absolutely love this game!! It is a game that I play every single day, (I actually just hit the day 30 mark on my daily bonus gifts so I got the radiant dragon, and it is so cool!!), but I just have one suggestion for the developers to make the game experience a little easier.

I know that there’s a way you can watch an ad to speed up the breeding process, but I also want there to be a way you can watch an ad to speed up the hatching process, because I am an avid collector of the dragons, and I want it to go faster instead of waiting for like 15 hours to get an egg to hatch, because sometimes it’s possibly another dragon that I already have, and I want to be able to sell it quickly to try and hatch another egg to try and get a different dragon.

Developers, if you see this, thank you so much for reading!"
US	1	2019-04-15	4.5.0	woolf12	Horrible game!!!	It won’t let me do anything it’s stuck in it says that I need to build stuff it doesn’t give me anything all the dragons are weak I can’t do anything play DragonCity it’s way better!

US	5	2019-04-15	4.5.0	kenzie171717	AWESOME!	I love the game it is so awesome getting to breed dragons and see what the result might be!! I love feeding and training my dragons. I would recommend to anybody even if they aren’t really into dragons because it’s such a good game. Just beware that most of the time when you launch the app there will be a chance to buy something with real money  so if you are getting this for someone younger just watch out when they launch the app. Other than that it’s an amazing game I would recommend to anybody!!!

But I’ve always had one suggestion. Why can’t you battle you friends? It would be cool to see how strong your friends are by battling and to show off your cool dragons. In total the game is great but in my opinion there should be an update where you can battle your friends

US	5	2019-04-09	4.5.0	FinniDragon17	Dragon Mania Legends pros and cons	"This game is great! 

If you didn't know, Dragon City copied off of this game so don't get Dragon City.

Anyway, Dragon Mania Legends is really fun. I play it all day and it is easy to obtain gems, gold, and food. You can battle in an arena or on a set of islands and collect dragons. You can pet your dragon for gold and feed them to make them stronger. I have been playing this game for a few days and I really enjoy it. 

Something I don't like about the game is that currently there is an evil advertisement that keeps coming up and it crashes the game. Dragon Mania Legends also takes a while to load, but I don't mind that.

I love this game and I totally recommend it for dragon lovers like me."
US	5	2019-04-09	4.5.0	heyplayadragon	How I love this game	This game is great the frequent new dragons is cool
US	4	2019-04-09	4.5.0	Siobean81	Great but could be better	Great game, however for the past day I can’t get past my daily gift claim without the game shutting down on me. I think we should earn more food with the longer hours considering what it takes to level up the dragons, and lastly, joining a clan is impossible!!! I try a quick join, but they say there is no clans available and if I request a clan, no one responds. Plus I wish the areas were a little better, it’s really hard maneuver any habitats around.

But there all a couple things that annoy me/could be added. 1: How come it says maximum number of this habitat built when you don’t have even one of that habitat? It’s annoying because I have all this space but I still cant place my dragons so I end up selling them. 2: Gems should be easier to get. The only way I know to get them is to buy them. It’s annoying.
US	5	2019-04-08	4.5.0	DragonLover25944	This Game Is Awesome	Who ever made this game, ah it’s the best dragon game I’ve ever played! I love this game keep it up! Your very creative! But I really need you to update how many habitats you can have! Overall great game!👍
US	5	2019-04-08	4.5.0	lilly the bosssssssa	DragonML	DragonML is great my fav game but it is to expensive
US	4	2019-04-08	4.5.0	Eva S. sher	Please read this guys!! I need this fixed!	"So; I’m just going to say this quickly. I have two glitches I need you to fix (PLEASE). One is that I can use my money on upgrading my habitats but nothing happens. Number 2, it say that I bought all possible habitats (The maximum amount) BUT it’s not true! I only have 5 fire habitats for example but it says I have the maximum so I can’t get more for my new dragon! It also says that I have maximum Divine and Legendary WHICH IS VERY UNTRUE. (I have none :()

Hoping for a response,
ShadowNinjaGirl :p"

US	5	2019-04-05		JoJo.MW	DRAGONS! DRAGONS! DRAGONS!🙃	I LOVE DragonML so much! It is the perfect game for dragon lovers like me! Only one thing that I would say: please make the prices a little lower. For people like me, I mean, we aren’t dragon experts yet so we aren’t going to have 3000 diamonds just there ready to go so please please please lower the prices for things. Also for the puzzle piece dragons, like when the special event happened and everyone was trying to get the ‘Kronos dragons’. Well they were WAY to many puzzle pieces! I mean 300, c’mon, you have to admit that is a little ridiculous. But still, get the game, you can battle other people, train and feed your dragons, join a clan, level them up, enchant them, and make them SUPER op! I love this game so much and really recommend that you get it!😚👍🌟
US	5	2019-04-04	4.5.0	God is Life🦁	Amazing Game! Don’t miss out!	Overall this game is amazing! I love all the dragons, and the story line and the events and stuff. I just wish that in the events it were a little easier for people who to finish them without having to use so many gems or pay for a VIP account. I realize you have to make money somehow, but it would’ve nice if “normal” players could achieve these things as well. Also it would be cool if the dragons had a different level up, you know how they change when they get to level 4... it would be awesome if there was another stage as well, like maybe after level 50 or something like that. Other than this the game is amazing! Super addicting. I’d play it every day, all day! Love it! Keep adding new things!
US	5	2019-04-04	4.5.0	An 8 year-old	A favor from a 8 year old.	This game is AWESOME I just wanna ask if um you could please have the dragons in the shop to cost dragon coins instead of gems please?🙂
US	5	2019-04-04	4.5.0	Ytemrald	I have played it in 2 devices but still LOVE IT!	Dml is a Excellent game! I had first downloaded it in me old I-pad when it was my 3rd birthday and I have played it till now when I am 9 In my new I-pad. The Game is well designed and has a lot of cool islands you can buy! And the variety of dragons are like endless! I just wish that to buying dragons and other stuff they could lower the budget of the diamonds cuz it’s a lot! But that doesn’t mean I hate it, I STILL LOVE IT AND ALWAYS WILL!
US	5	2019-04-04	4.5.0	Jkatt5t	BEST GAME EVER	"Okay let me start by saying i love how they evolve in my singing monsters they didn’t evolve at all and this is just my favorite game

         Thanks for reading.😊"
US	4	2019-04-04	4.5.0	idk names are hard	Please read	I don’t know if you guys will see this or not but, one thing that I really want and probably so many others is a messaging system I know global chat is disabled right not but whenever it comes back if it does could you guys make it where we can talk to a certain person without global chat please?
US	3	2019-04-04	4.5.0	waltimus prime	My likes and dislikes	I love this game but I only have one concern I’m not much of a fan on how when you battle with a certain dragon you can only use the elements as an attack and I thought that the game could be updated so other attacks can be used.
US	5	2019-04-04	4.5.0	Hannah Sachie	Super Fun	I recommend this game. So fun. You get to build Dragons. I do wish they had PRETTIER AND CUTER DRAGONS. BECAUSE SOME ARE REALLY UGLY.

US	1	2019-04-03	4.5.0	Heaven Wept	No Longer a Family App	When the game began it was safe for all ages. It evolved, adding Clans, groups players must join in order to participate in most events. These plans may or may not have appropriate chat content. The developers also incorporated a global chat which is grossly inappropriate for children. Cyber Bullying, threats of violence to include killing are very common. Players continually ask other players how old they are and what their location is. Although I have reached out to the developers they continue to make this game less and less appropriate for children. The other concern is a feature that allows players to see other players locations in relationship to where they are. Players can see how many kilometers another player is away from their location. This needs to be change from everyone reading two older adults. It is unsafe.
US	4	2019-04-03	4.5.0	RainbowwolfYT2	Dragon mania legends	It’s a really fun game I love getting all the cool dragons and participating in the events the only thing I dislike is how long things take like to hatch an egg or wait on a building to finish or farming food or anything else

I love the game otherwise."
US	5	2019-04-03	4.5.0	that_girl132	PLEASE FIX	So when the update happened, every time I tried to collect my rewards it said reconnecting and logged me out. And the app acted like I never got in to DML. But besides that AWESOME game!!!❤️❤️❤️
US	5	2019-04-03	4.5.0	Cllort	Great game but two minor issues	The game is amazing but the thing is that some dragons look more like dinosaurs because they dont have dargon features and making the gems less expensive that’s really all that I have to say the melon dragons from this game dont really look like dragons nor dose the earth dragon and tiger dragon
US	5	2019-04-02	4.5.0	Alex baily	Great	"I love this game so much. It could be improved if you can sell dragons or give them to a friend while they are in the Hatchery. 
Also it would be fun if you could battle your friends."
US	3	2019-04-02	4.5.0	fhdjrigudhbeksns	Hey guys please fix this	Okay to start off with something positive well the art for these dragons are like amazing and the designs. Another thing about this game that it does not have a lot of lag tho which makes it smooth to play, it the game is also super fun to play which makes the player want to play more. Here are some negative things first of all, the ads , the ads are annoying and I mean it... they pop up every second, and May I tell you they are all about drugs and alcohol? Like we all know what that is once you seen it a few times then it’s fine but if you see it all the time everyday! You can’t stand it anymore. You don’t need to have the ads pop up every time it’s pretty annoying, the other thing is when you have to pay for dragons with REAL MONEY!! Yes you heard me, this is a free game so that means everything is free in the game but not all things are free, this reminds me of a clickbait game when you say it’s free but it’s not and you would need to pay 99.99 for diamonds and for coins even the dragons, these are my complaints.

US	4	2019-04-02	4.5.0	Fred's Harley	Robbed	I feel I’ve been robbed because when I spend millions to find an opponent I think I can beat the game says lost contact. Then when I go back to enchanted the opponent is busy then I have to spend millions to find another opponent that I think I can beat. Frustrating to play then spend it all just to get a little ahead.

US	4	2019-04-02	4.5.0	itzzz_wonton	Great game, kinda expensive tho.	I love this game on how well it’s designed, but I just don’t like the amount of gems you need  in order to skip things. First of all, you don’t even get that many gems from leveling up. Buying the gems won’t help you that much either. I just hope that they would lower the gems required to skip time.
US	5	2019-04-02	4.5.0	idontknowbihgoaway	Pretty good! Except...	I think that this is a really fun and addictive game, but one think that I really don’t like is the “only one leaves ad” because one day I was showing my 4 year old niece this game and of course, the ad pops up and my niece got very scared, I think since this game is for all ages you should remove that ad and replace it with a more child friendly one.
US	5	2019-04-02	4.5.0	Rachelgonzalez7777777	DML review	Dragon mania legends is my favorite phone apps I can’t say anything bad about it other than the events are hard.If you struggle with play games where you progress slowly I wouldn’t

US	3	2019-04-01	4.4.0	gamergirl 2000	Inappropriate ads	"Don't get me started on this game. I love it but there have been a lot of inappropriate ads. For starters, there is a "" Only one leaves"" ad and it's disturbing. There are Olson "" the real cost "" ads where the x button doesn't work. I believe that they should remove these ads and replace them with regular game ads. For example, "" Clash of clans "" or "" Hole.io "". There are so many other ads that they could advertise and they remove the original ones and replace them because, don't you think that kids play this game? I would like some change from my review. Thank you for reading this."

US	4	2019-03-29	4.4.0	1pounceseal🤖👽📽🎥📹🎞🏝	Cool 😎 and ok	Its ok 👌 I guess. I love this game but there are pros and cons. Cons,really can’t stand ads but the game show the same add over and over again. It’s annoying🥵. Also I hate that you can only type in a 6 letter name. The name of the game has more letters in its 🤨. Other games let you have a name that has more than 6 letters. Pros cool events😏 and 🐉. Music 🎶 reminds me of my first time playing this game.so,if you are doing an update, please mix up some ads and don’t have a limit for the number of letters in a name. Thanks!!🐲
US	5	2019-03-29	4.4.0	spi7z3r0ni0	Amazing	"This so so much better than other games of this type, I sincerely hope this game doesn’t become a pay-to-play type of game anytime soon and hopefully never, the game is much more organic, a beautiful tutorial, and actually lets you choose what your gonna breed instead of leaving it up to chance, there are so many amazing qualities to this game, 50/10 without a doubt

Edit: maybe make it so you don’t have to pay real money to get a new island? Make it gems instead please and thank you!"
US	4	2019-03-28	4.4.0	nightime crystal	Greet game but	I think that DML is a great game but the breeding time is super long and it a little are to get gems but This game is the better  version for dragon city love the game🤩
US	5	2019-03-27	4.4.0	TayTotTime26	Great game, but some recommendations	I had this game awhile ago, but deleted it for space. I was looking at apps to get because I was bored, and I found this. Even though I thought that all of my progress would be lost, it wasn't! I was really happy. Then, I Started to notice that it was pretty hard to level up. I had many epic dragons, and I couldn't buy the temples to make them level up further. Also, the levels get pretty hard as you go up. Overall, this app has tiny flaws but it is a great time killer and it's addictive! Consider downloading it, you probably won't regret it!!!!!!!
US	4	2019-03-27	4.4.0	gftreewqssdccxxsdfvvbnhhikmn	It won’t let me have a clan called the Harry Potter clan!	It’s not fair that the game won’t let me have a clan called the Harry Potter clan “Potter” is not an inappropriate word
US	1	2019-03-26	4.4.0	nightfury011918	Game loft only cares for money	These guys don’t even care about you. I’ve waited a long time for these gems I got for free but they don’t even care to give me them. All these people care about is your money. They don’t care about your happiness with the game at all. The Zeus and Poseidon dragons are nearly impossible to get unless you buy gems. I’ve spent weeks doing these different ad tasks to earn as much gems for free as I can because their’s are outrageously priced. And now that I’ve been earning them they won’t even give them to me. This game is fun and all but really frustrating that it is difficult to get rare dragons unless you buy gems.

US	5	2019-03-24	4.4.0	Lexi and me	It is a great game	The only thing that I would change is that it is supper hard to get gems but almost everything needs gems to bye.
US	5	2019-03-24	4.4.0	Mim2abbyg	Vary good game	I Played this game and then quit in over a year I found this game again and then I started playing again it’s a very good game and it brings back old memories.
US	2	2019-03-24	4.4.0	dragontlm	If you like commercials...	Then this game is for you. EVERY two minutes a pop-up ad that blocks game play, ruins the flow, and aggravates to no end. And if you didn't see it the first 500 times it ran, then maybe you'll notice it the second 500 times they throw it in your face. Except for this, the game is great, but the EXCESSIVE interference in gameplay by the ads ruins the experience.

US	4	2019-03-22	4.4.0	Overwatch777	Ads	There are too many tobacco ads and they take forever to get through. My game just freezes and a minute later the ad pops up.
US	5	2019-03-22	4.4.0	DML player	Fun game!	I gotta admit, the same animations and body types can get old after a while, so I’d like if you could make some more unique and memorable dragons, but other than that, it’s an enjoyable app. Speeding things up does cost a lot of gems, but its evened out by how relatively abundant they are to get. My only complaint is that some dragons are inaccessible unless you pay for them. It would be great if we could get the ash/planet/etc as a dragon of the month one of these days.
US	5	2019-03-21	4.4.0	motochick232	Love it!!!	I absolutely love this game. I play every chance I get😍 my little brother plays as well. Me and him also love race cars though. Is it possible to make a race car dragon? I mean this game has a dragon for every occasion. I think some people would appreciate it. Mostly us 😅 even if there never is a motor head dragon we’re gonna keep playing. Dml for life 🤣

US	5	2019-03-21	4.4.0	ian yanh	it’s fun becaouse you get dragons it’s cool	The game is super fun
US	5	2019-03-21	4.4.0	cue-ball-3	Overall game	Okay dragon mania legends is an amazing game to play,  it has area battles and campaign battles that you do , with the castle events and the exploring of dungeons to find chronos. It is a complex game that varies from amazing but not so amazing in some areas. I understand that the game is hard to animate and it takes a while to come up with new events and such, like the divine events, so challenging and fun, but there still lies some tension that I have personally. The game is lacking an adventure or a higher level that you can get, yes you level up your dragons, but what if they evolved higher, it’s a stretch yes, but I just think it’d be cool. Also what I think is a good idea is a new habitat, one that is separated from the others, like a floating habitat, only for a special type of dragon and the dragon typing could be moon,sun,eclipse, anything that any of the producers think of. I know that what I am asking for is very hard and animations are complicated and new models and new ideas it’s very complicated and very complex. I’m not asking you to do anything if these things I’m just trying to implement good ideas. The game itself right now is amazing and it’s wonderful to play. Thank you , if you read this , I’m thinking some people think this way as well, I’m just not sure. Thank you again and keep on adding and making the game even better than it is already !

I try to give it a earth habitat but it doesn’t let me.i sell it to a person and I don’t have a dust dragon anymore. So can you get rid of the “habitat don’t let me build “ glitch please. So I can get the dust dragon back?
US	5	2019-03-17	4.4.0	Explore alaska	Dragon mania legends	The game is so on point, I really want to play all day it’s the most clever game I have ever seen!!! I like everything about it I would highly recommend it
US	5	2019-03-17	4.4.0	Kyla4853	Love it	The only thing to make this game better is to add potions you can earn during battle that passes a curtain amount of time. Like let’s say I beat a battle I could get like an hour or half hour potion to make breeding or hatching or speeding up for energy FOR battle

US	5	2019-03-17	4.4.0	dragon mania 7382$	A real one review	This game is cold asf. Been rocking with it for about 3 years now. Good way to kill time. If you into stuff like sky rim, for honor, etc and you’re a nerd like me I suggest this game to you. Starts off slow,  but worth the wait.
US	5	2019-03-16	4.4.0	Ikra-Playz	I’ve loved this game for years!	Apparently I’ve had this game for 3 years? (I forgot I had it) After getting back to the game though, I fell in love with it! I love he designs for the dragons and the abilities that come with each element. It makes the battling more tactical than just type advantage, which I love! I honestly just love the whole game in general and can’t pick out specifics of what I like because it’s all of it!!!
US	5	2019-03-16	4.4.0	alpaca 21	So cute!! And fun!!	Is a great way to spend that  extra time on the side. The instructions are very easy and is so fun. The dragons every time get more adorable. You can win gems, extra coins by fighting with others. You have adventures, a world to expand, upgrade at your taste and decore like you want! It doesn’t matter your age I’m old and I’m still enjoying this game like a 10 year old! Try it you won’t regret it!
US	5	2019-03-16	4.4.0	Mia kitty cat	Game is 👍	This game is really really 👍. I wish you could purchase gems with coins. Overall this game is great, and I like the AR. Thanks this game is so great!
US	3	2019-03-16	4.4.0	Engels Soza	Problema o Estafa	"El juego tiene un cierto problema que si uno es VIP con las gemas que recolecta de nada le sirve porque todas las extras VIP que tienen que dar solo la refleja no las ingresa al inventario otra cosa aun dando ganas de comprar GEMAS pero si da problema en lo Gemas de recolección como será pagada los dragones un estatus muy alto de Dinero y Gemas...

US	5	2019-03-15	4.4.0	ugvhgjhhbjhfhmvrtfhgv	I love this game but.......	"I do love this game. There’s so much to do that you could play for hours. That being said I do have 2 major issues. 

One being the fact you can’t zoom out very far. It seems so insignificant but there are so many islands and it just irritates me that I can’t zoom out farther to see them all. I tend to get lost because the screens so zoomed in. 

Next is the clutter. There is so much stuff on the edges of the screen. I’m always click something I didn’t mean too and have to close out of it because there is so much stuff on the screen. Making a task bar or something would be so much better and cleaner than having EVERYTHING out"

The events tht come up are fun tho I don't like when u need VIP for one of them an it gets you a better dragon.  But now I'm having a crashing problem cause when I do the daily quests an it gives me a prize after completing two of them but as it does tht the app kicks me out.

US	2	2019-03-11	4.4.0	jennarayetion	TOO MANY ADS!!	I’ve been playing DML for over a year. It’s fun and has so many cool, unique dragons. The only downside and absolutely annoyance is the overwhelming amount of ads. I can hardly play the game without being harassed by non stop pop-ups. The game is basically 80% ads. I have since taken a hiatus because it has become impossible to play or enjoy anymore.
US	2	2019-03-11	4.4.0	ookamiwhitewolf	Too many annoying advertisements	Seriously they aren’t even good advertisements, theyre pop up and happen way to frequently.  I’ve been with dragon mania legends since the beginning, I have the first anniversary badge and everything.  The advertisements are just too many for the amount of fun the game offers.  That’s why I’m deleting it now, after waiting to see if the problem got better.  It didn’t -_-

US	4	2019-03-08	4.4.0	Skiddoodle	Ads very annoying	Great game, although the spamming ads Avery few minutes is annoying. It’s weird how the x button doesn’t work to get of, but the “see more” and “learn more” buttons do.
US	5	2019-03-08	4.4.0	Kxxani	Battle	"The Game is good but can you please add where you can battle your friends with your dragons. Will make the game even better. 

Thank You"

US	5	2019-03-07	4.4.0	DragonML forever	Best game ever	Thank you so much for creating DragonML I love the game please create more games like this
US	5	2019-03-07	4.4.0	Isabel Ms	Anonymous	Love the game and all but too many ads I would play it for about 7 mins and I would get the same 3 ads in those 7 mins and it can get pretty irritating after a while.
US	5	2019-03-07	4.4.0	egyptscotland18	DragonML	It is a grate game and I love it however adds pop up out of nowhere that you can’t get out of and everything is overpriced and it’s hard to get gems.
US	4	2019-03-07	4.4.0	røses	Somewhat confusing, but good game	I would easily give this five stars, but when you buy gems, which are unfortunately hard to get, it takes a while for them to load to your game. Otherwise, good job, and the dragons are adorable!  The in app purchases are just confusing. Thank you for your time!
US	5	2019-03-07	4.4.0	Canvas-Lover	Yes	"Omigosh I am stuck on this game. Usually I go back and forth between games and get bored with them in a week, but this is amazing. I think everything actual money wise is a little expensive. Having to buy dragons for gems costs ALOT of gems too. Plz put down expense. What is great about dml is that it has a lot more to do rather than other dragon games. Really, if you have not gotten this app yet, you have to get it. Now. Also, do not get other dragon games. This game has way more fun stuff. Also, totally agree with other comments. Plz allow to battle with friends. Would be so much fun. Also, adds are super annoying. If you are going to put adds, put less.
PLZ MAKE EASIER AND LESS EXPENSIVE TO GET GEMS

US	3	2019-03-01	4.4.0	Expelcius	Max habitats too expensive	Game is decent, dragons are cute, but you can’t have 4 per habitat unless you’re at a high level and then it costs enchanting materials.  Land is at a premium if you want to collect all the dragons, you can’t decorate your islands.
US	2	2019-03-01	4.4.0	KariTheGoat	Latest Update has messed up my game	"Been playing for years. After the update several days ago, I have been unable to do any quests or special events, cannot access my clan, my dragons all show up as black shadows with question marks on them, I cannot collect gold from my shadow or light habitats, cannot collect food from some of my farms. Game continuously tells me I need to upload 0.0 mb more data to access additional features, and when I say yes to download, it automatically says “Download aborted” and refuses to upload it. 

This has gone on for 3 days, wasted 3 days of my VIP membership, and I am getting extremely frustrated. Emailed support and nothing was done about it and no response."

US	4	2019-02-27	4.4.0	Broccli ark	Enjoy exploring more than battle	Dragons are enjoyable yet to open a region it takes about 200 million, with 1 mil earned per day, taking months, opening the attic , disappointing that the dragons can not explore there, I thought there was a hidden spaceship they would get to explore

It roams around the islands scaring other dragons while they eat. It is a vicious dragon with no mercy and crushes Vikings like a bug. It loves watching its enemies fall.”

Bye"

US	4	2019-02-27	4.4.0	🔥Nightfire🔥	Totally awesome and worthwhile but.........	So I’ve played the game before a lot of the bugs have been fixed thank you for that by the way. But back to what I want I have 2 days out of the whole week Saturday and Sunday. So I really don’t like week events. Overall I love DragonML but there are still some bugs. Ok picture this I am perfectly fine and capable of getting an awesome dragon but I have to get through levels. So I think so what I can do that but then when I got through a full circle of 24 rounds. I’m all like yay I get the dragon I want yeah yeah. But noooo I have to get thrown around and play 96 more rounds while waiting like two hours in between all of them and possibly more so I recommend not to get this game if you have limited time as in you only have two days out of the week. PLEASE REMEMBER TO RELPLY TO ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!

Is there some way I could possible get them back?

This is getting a problem because it costs like 20,000 food to feed my dragon up one bit. It costs like 80,000 to level them up to level 22. Level 22 is the level that I need to find the seals! It’s either that luck isn’t on my side or there is a glitch. I think this level is way to high for the ruins. From Pikapika141.

All right listen by the way I’m using dictation so if some of the words are misspelled it’s not my fault Anyway what happened to my links dragon I got it fair and square in the arena and you remove it without any compensation that is just so rude I lost my Dragon I didn’t get anything for it that’s just not fair this game is great it would be five stars but I lost my Dragon and you didn’t even give me one bit of compensation for it so yeah the end.
US	4	2019-02-21	4.3.0	Sealpup101	No more adds!!	I love Dragon Mania Legends!! It’s so much fun. But there are WAY to many pop up adds.

US	4	2019-02-14	4.3.0	Nharmonia4ever	Would be more fun without ads	I love this game, but I’m repeatedly shown ads with traumatic images on them. They are for raising awareness for vaping, but they scare me so much that I force quit the app. There are too many apps that only care about money, so those greedy people enable ads and provide no way of permanently removing ads. The love of money is the root of all evil, and scaring people is evil. If you actually cared about the players, you would remove ads. Please remove ads to improve the game!
US	5	2019-02-14	4.3.0	Shadyaja	This game is amazing	I love all the dangans and I think maybe can u lower the cones on half of the tepels and all the other stuff love your game
US	5	2019-02-13	4.3.0	Mia kitty cat	Awesome game!	Is really good I like the fact that The dragons aren’t your normal dragons. The Kitty Dragon has to be my favorite One! But I wish you could get rid of the ads. Even though this is a great game, I wish it didn’t have ads.
US	5	2019-02-13	4.3.0	buckeye121	So addicting	I will play this all day on the weekends!  Breeding and feeding the dragons are so fun and addicting.
US	5	2019-02-13	4.3.0	Izzy_retard	Awesome	This is so fun and addictive at first I thought it was dumb but I change my mind. Awesome game keep up the good work.
US	4	2019-02-11	4.3.0	MissChris6375	More islands desperately needed	There are too many dragons available for way too little space. All the islands need to be bigger, the number of habitats available needs to increase, and the food should be more plentiful. This game is artificially slow. It takes way too much work to get and grow dragons. Sometimes the *reward* of food is 200 berries when it takes almost TWO MILLION berries to level up a level 50 dragon. The developers need to step it up and reward long time players.
US	5	2019-02-10	4.3.0	🍀Clover🍀2018	Amazing! Though, a few changes wold make it even better!	I love this game! It’s great for an eight year old who is picky with her games, though, I had a really advanced game and, I got a new iPad, where I had deleted the game, And now... I lost all the data! If you could find my account, I would be so happy! Sophia, Signing out!
US	4	2019-02-10	4.3.0	SamanthaVixa	What even?	"I LOVE this game! It is so much better than any dragon game out there with the better graphics, better gameplay, and more creativity it is by far one of the best games out there.
So why did I give it four stars then?
Recently I have encountered a problem. Two, actually. They are quite minor but if they could somehow be fixed it would be nice
1) events. I am currently on the last stage of the Pigsy event, and I was SO HAPPY to finally be able to complete it when I come across a battle. Normally I do super well with these, so it shouldn’t be a problem, right? Right? Wrong. The dragons I got selected for me were about 20 lower than the dragons for the battle, and they weren’t even enchanted! Where did all of my other dragons go? Why can’t I battle with those like I did for every other one? And heck, why not just skip it? It costs 2,600 lampoons to skip it. That’s about as much as you can buy for 50 dollars, and there is NO WAY I am spending that much on this game. I’ve already spent way to much on it and I need to stop. If it weren’t such a good game, I would be giving it one star because of this. One star. Wow. Gee, thanks
2) age. I don’t want to share my birth certificate, as I am TERRIFIED of identity theft as it has already happened to me at least twice in my life, but that’s the only way to change the age. I am 15, nearly 16, but my brother owned the game before I did and he is younger than I am, so that is the age that was entered and I still can’t access the chat to ask why I got kicked out of a clan or just to check in with my friends from different clans. I have dealt with plenty of vulgar language before, and was about to use it in the previous section above. I can handle bullying. Trust me. You don’t want to know how many times it’s happened in real life
Anyways... I hope these issues can be fixed? I would say it is a great game but now... I’m not so sure I would have given it four stars"
US	5	2019-02-09	4.3.0	Deadly Gecko246	Beautiful Dragons!	Okay, so I am into art mainly dragons. These animations are adorable, and the dragon’s detail with scales. I can tell that some of the models are the same and that’s okay. You can be a little lazy sometimes - But this takes effort and this game has it! (Also when you “tickle” them or well pet them it’s adorable, that’s what I have a soft spot for.) - 5 star rating from me! But here are a few suggestions maybe decrease the time it takes as in to play and wait for eggs that sums down the game a bit, and then it gets boring. 😋
US	5	2019-02-09	4.3.0	Fanny ting	It's very good	It's very good but can u do the
US	4	2019-02-09	4.3.0	noahdinosaurman	Please fix	Please make it so that if you have one egg in your inventory you can’t buy the same egg twice.
US	5	2019-02-08	4.3.0	dragon mania lover 28	Love it	Omg this is my favorite game ever I love it it’s so good not like any other dragon game it is more creative and more fun than Dragon city love it so so so so much favorite game I’ve ever played and very addicting
US	5	2019-02-08	4.3.0	Bitemestripe	How awesome this game is.	Well, first I would like to start with the new features, such as global chat.  Great job on the sensors! But, flaw n. 1! There is a way to bypass the sensors. Just put a #8 in the middle of the word, and the sensor ignores it. Even if it’s a curse word. Please fix that. Flaw n. 2! You should be able to fully remove the people that use bad terms, not just an ignore button.  But the overall game is great! I could use more gems for though.

US	5	2019-02-02	4.3.0	eevee #131	Amazing Game	"This game is awesome! I play it almost every day but I don’t battle much anymore so can you make special battling events where you fight a boss that that becomes more powerful each time you defeat and each time you deafeat it you get a reward? Like after these many stages of battling you win this dragon?
Please consider my idea."

US	4	2019-01-31	4.3.0	Potato_god000	Update	I wish you could have more than 19 habitats but it also might be limiting me because I’m not a high enough level. If you can only have 19 habitats I really wish that would change.
US	4	2019-01-31	4.3.0	lia190	Too many ads	I love this game! but this new update has too many ads popping up and it’s annoying
US	4	2019-01-31	4.3.0	Tuneses	Few minor details but great game	So, it is a very fun and addicting game, but, I have some things u could change. Maybe we could like, go to other people’s islands and talk to them with Chat. Also, rate them. Another thing is that we could desine a  character and ride ur dragons and race other people! Well, those where suggestions, but these, are things u could change. Maybe, instead of frustratingly getting the same egg many times, if u already have that dragon, u could get one of the other ones🙃. sorry for bothering you with that stupid review I’m bad at that. BYE!

US	2	2019-01-31	4.3.0	Angel Najiuma	Good game	It’s really a amazing game the physics quality and that you go around conquering the map. I recommend downloading it I really do! There is a slight problem “The Real cost” Ads I know Children Shouldn’t vap/Smoke But The ads can be really gross I’m starting to play less of it because of this ads I prefer ads that tell you to play this game That’s why this game is getting 2 Stars My brother got really freaked out because of the ads so My Mother Had to Buy the “No ads” cause he didn’t go to his iPad for a week and I really think a Child shouldn’t be afraid just because of a ad.
US	5	2019-01-31	4.3.0	mkm1946	New update	"The new update demands too much downloading. Cannot even continue to play. Cannot continue the current challenge. Very disappointed

US	5	2019-01-30	4.3.0	dragon lover 225	DML review	I love DML so much this is my favorite game. It has so many dragons and I love mythical creatures and dragons are my favorite. They look so sweet and recently I have been taking snap shots and drawing the dragons. And not to mention that the game seems totally fair. I think all of it’s policies and in app purchases are fair. I had this game for about three months and it is now like a hobby or what ever. I love how detailed the dragons are and how colorful they are. I also love to battle dragons and show those vikings who is boss. My dragons seem so happy. I also like to participate in events such as winter events and others.  you can earn dragons trough events to. I think everyone will love this game and a special thanks to game loft🐉🐲❤️

US	2	2019-01-30	4.3.0	Dynocation	❌Terrible Ads, Bad UI, Okay gameplay	"I was so close to rating this game 4 stars when it decided it was going to randomly shove ads into my gameplay out of nowhere so I’d accidentally click on them.

BAD DESIGN #1:
Ads pop up without warning even long video ads where it’s better to just close the game and restart it. Takes me out of whatever I’m doing. Reminds me of poorly built websites in how the ads pop up. 

BAD DESIGN #2:
“Please pay $2.99 to unlock dragon” Ha ha ha! I just started playing the game and I’m not going to shill money on a so far worthless dragon. Sometimes I throw developers a bone when the game is good, but this game is really presenting itself as trash so far and these “special dragons” are literally just repainted versions of other dragons. 

BAD DESIGN #3: 
Gems are extremely over priced. I don’t mind paying 99¢ for 100 gems in a game, but this game Ha! Their prices are $50 - $100! They also push a scummy “payment plan”. I mean if you’re going to be a free to play game. BE A FREE TO PLAY GAME.

GOOD THING #1:
The art is nice. 

GOOD THING #2:
The gameplay is okay, but after 5 minutes of playing you run into the ol “wait 24 hours” many bad apps slide in. 

I wish these things could be fixed, but I have a feeling just by playing the developers don’t care about user experience. They just want, as Mr. Krabs would say, “Money”."
US	2	2019-01-30	4.3.0	AnubusPrime	Lack of imagination	"There's little to no difference in the dragons, except in the visual creativity. Every dragon with water powers does the same as every other dragon with water powers. Etc etc. The story is insanely difficult way to early. ""Hey I should have no problem betting that boss who's at level 8"". 😑One shotted by an element that has no benefit against my dragon. Change the fact that I still have to wait 8 hours for a dragon I've already hatched 9 times. This game has promise but right now is nothing to spread the word about. In game purchases and time requirements are set in poor taste, clearly set to “frustrate” you into paying past them. Been away for a year and I had hoped it changed, but sadly it did not"

I have so many fuse enchantments but not the right enchantment. It is so hard to get the enchant my dragons again cause they need a special enchantment. I was waiting for a month or two and I'm still waiting. Again it's so hard finding them and I don't have enough money to pay for gems then get tickets. Maybe add the ability to defuse enchantments and get the ones you need back. That would make this game even better cause I've been waiting forever and still nothing. Please if you can add the ability to defuse enchantments.

US	1	2019-01-21	4.2.0	AKosDaBoss	Disappointing	I really wanted to give this 5 stars. It’s a fun game. It really is. But like pretty much every other game anymore, the code is written to push you to frustration to the point where you’ll pay money to cross some barrier. I’ve watched dozens upon dozens of ad videos to hopefully earn a prize only to fall just short right as the prize expires. It’s teasing you to get you fork over cash. Sad. It’s clearly a game marketed towards kids, but luckily the player base seems to be a bit older and hopefully not so susceptible to their tricks.

I took a couple years on break then there was a bunch  of new stuff! I was so happy and now I play it every day I am level 70. I ran into an issue in the enchantment league where I was fighting with my level 35 Pixie dragon against a monk dragon and in the corner it had the little WiFi trying to connect thingy, and it was at 3 bars, then it went back to the loading screen and the battle music was still playing. It went back into the game perfectly fine but it crashed for some odd reason. It wasn’t my WiFi, I was right next to the router. Could you maybe fix this? Thanks. :) From: Pikapika141

US	4	2018-12-30	4.2.0	Ajstar123	.	I really love this game and I am EXTREMELY ADDICTED but something I don’t understand is when you are battling with other dragons owned by the vikings  not only do the other dragons get more than one shot at you but you SOMETIMES get another shot at them.

US	1	2018-12-29	4.2.0	Cinna547	Terrible game I would give it less stars if I could	Ok so let’s first start off that when I bought a water habitat and I placed it on a island and I had to wait 1 hour for it to be built, so I did and I went out of the game but when I came back the water habitat was no longer there and I still had the amount of coins that I had before I spent them. It didn’t save my progress?! I was so angry so I had to buy the water habitat again and wait ANOTHER hour!  Next thing that’s annoying in this game is the overflowing amount of ADS!!!!! Whenever I watch videos to get gems it doesn’t give me gems. Also ads pop up randomly and I’m unable to exit them so I must exit the entire game. Another thing that bugs me is that the game always glitches! ALWAYS!! So it automatically kicks me out of the game! This game should get fixed!
US	1	2018-12-29	4.2.0	Xaktheslayer	Adding a friend is impossible	My boyfriend who I know has the game is unable to add me by recruitment code and I’m unable to do the same. It states the code is wrong. It’s not. We can’t add each other through Facebook either due to our names not popping up. On my game his name will not pop up even if I physically type it in. The game is great. But because of this. I hate it. I downloaded it so I could play with him. So I’d be able to check his progress and so on. Please fix this. Thanks.
US	4	2018-12-29		Yehyie	Great game, but too many ads	This is an amazing game to play, but every 3-5 min, there’s a lunchable ad. It gets really annoying too because sometimes there’s no “x” button to click off, and I have to exit the whole game and go back in again. Other than that the game is amazing, but please fix this.
US	3	2018-12-28	4.2.0	nova strike	Love the game but can’t get out of the lunchable ad	I played dragon mania legends but every time the lunchable ad  is unable to get out of

US	3	2018-12-28	4.2.0	ijustwanttocomplain	Problem with ads	Okay, so whenever my little sister tries playing the game at times a lunchables ad would pop up and not be able to go away. And it ends up with her having to close the app and open it up again. It’s ridiculous! But overall it’s a pretty good game though there are so many ads.
US	4	2018-12-28	4.2.0	mimibigboi	Dragon review	So I really like the game but I think they should give you more gems because you have to use them a lot also I didn’t like how I couldn’t name my dragon “thataintitcheif” besides that I LOVE this game.🤩🤩

US	5	2018-12-27	4.2.0	Paco El Músico	Awesome variety, great gameplay, hours, days, and years of entertainment.	"I don’t know when I started this game,  but it was more than a year ago, and it was a great game back then as well. Things have only gotten better.

The battling is fun, but even the breeding and collecting is enough entertainment for me. There are so many ways you could play this game depending on what you’re looking for (collecting versus training). Even if all you want to do is pet your dragons so that they sneeze gold at you. 

I don’t usually write reviews but this game is one of the few that has secured a permanent spot on my iphone. It can take up some memory for sure, but for me it’s been worth it."
US	3	2018-12-26	4.2.0	lacetteduran	T	The game is really good but the prices are to high😕

US	5	2018-12-24	4.2.0	me you dont need to know	This is a good game	"I think this game is very fun and is fair with all included details. It is addictive but you know when to come off. It also makes you run out of things, in the game, which lets you know to take a break. This is a enjoyable game to have on your phone/tablet/ipad.  
P.S please note that everyone does get frustrated with any game from time to time. It is no need to get overly mad and rate bad toward the app. You have to get used to the game (don’t judge a book by the cover). And see for yourself the good and bad of the game. 

My rating is five star"
US	5	2018-12-24	4.2.0	lovlyclara	This game is great except one thing	This game is fun and entertaining. Except I deleted it and and didn’t play it for over a year. I downloaded it again but the game did not reset. I was not able to start fresh again with a new world. I know updates have changed the game story line and was looking forward to experiencing it. But I was not able to. I feel like when ever you delete the app it should reset everything.

US	2	2018-12-16	4.2.0	Zedozkyosw	Ads	There are too many forced ads in a game where you can watch an ad to speed up something you might be waiting on. Takes away from the experience
US	5	2018-12-16	4.2.0	Igzgi l blxgkzgizhofzgixhp	My data	This game is amazing, filled with daily quest and more! However, when I was updating the app, I went back into the game, before I updated the app I had a legendary dragon I breed and it was during a event, when I updated I went from level 59 to level q I lost all my data, I had to do the tutorial and now I have only 7 dragons I used to have 80-something. It was really sad, I also put money into the game so everything I did was gone. ;-;

US	3	2018-12-16		RAGINGfox0629	It’s ok	I used to have this game for a while but I found it pretty fun! I’m re-downloading hoping that the hatching time would have improved and I wouldn’t have to wait that long anymore. A lot of the stuff in the game is too difficult to get especially since it’s not that’s addicting... but it does make you feel accomplished once you’ve grown your own dragon! They are very cute!
US	5	2018-12-15	4.2.0	Alumina6	Amazing app	I’ve been playing this game for over a year now, over all it’s awesome!
US	1	2018-12-15	4.2.0	Hot Chocolates	Great	I had enjoyed this game but it wouldn’t let me connect to Facebook I tried many time but it doesn’t work. Eventually something happened to the game and I lost all my progress. I used to be level 29 and now I have to restart. I decided to try different dragon breeding since I’m in the beguining.
US	3	2018-12-15	4.2.0	🧜🏽‍♀️🧜🏽‍♂️	Ish	Fun but can get boring
US	3	2018-12-15	4.2.0	MysticWolfz	Ehhhh	"This game is pretty good..... ,but I don’t want to want that long time to hatch my dragon. I mean like by the time I finish everything I need to do, I’m still waiting for the egg to hatch! That’s the first problem for me.

Next problem is that I don’t know why maybe it’s just me, but it takes forever to level up, while in the other ratings they don’t have this problem. So maybe it is me but I just wanna day that I think it takes a long time to level up.

Ok ok so I know I’ve been talking bad about this game, but let me put in the actual good things about this game. 

First I like all the dragons you can breed, they added a nice and the dragons look cool. 

Now that I said one good thing about this for now, is that the breeding also takes a lot of time. Personal I don’t like to wait that long, when I have already have the dragon it breeds me another one of the the same kind, but that breeding time is longer when I already have the dragon!!!! 

The next great thing about this game is that you can fight many other dragons from the other teams! For me I say they have quite a lot of dragons.

Last bad thing is I run out of food really fast, and I have a lot of dragons while feeding the dragons I already have, while feeding the new dragons I have. 

So two great things, first dragons give you coins when you pet them. The higher level the more coins you get now that’s great. Second thing when you unlock training your dragon in the level up it’s power I love that idea. 

Over all the game is pretty good if you like games that take a long time in breeding and hatching eggs, and fighting with other dragons then you will love this game. For me it’s a ehhh , but for sure give this game a try and download it. Try it your maybe what I said was wrong and breeding and hatching eggs is fast for you , again download the game yourself and test it out!"

US	3	2018-12-11	4.2.0	🙂dog/huskie lover🙂	Read this please	I like the game but I am sick of vaping adds because I don’t vape and vape adds keep popping up but if you have ever played a game with lots of adds you can handle the adds and that is the only problem. Revised I have bought Dragon Fury 5 times and when I use it in battle it won’t let me tap (Sarcastically) So thanks, you have made me waste my Hard earned coins on a crappy app ,Thanks! And have a bad day developers. If you are thinking about getting this quite a few adds but you’ll be able to handle it and NEVER BUY DRAGON FURY!

US	3	2018-12-10	4.2.0	dragontlm	The game is great, BUT...	... far too many ads. On a good day, ads pop up every 2 minutes (I timed them). Occasionally, they come every 30 seconds. REALLY puts a crimp in game play. And the same ad (for Puffs) comes up over and over.......must have seen it 500 times. If the game weren't so good, I would trash it just because of all the ads.

US	1	2018-12-07	4.2.0	Muppt	Ads!!	The game is a struggle to play with the ads popping up over the screen every minute or so, blocking what you are trying to do until you can exit out of it. So frustrating!

Though GAMELOFT pretty nice job with the graphics. Also all the time for the announcements it says 99 though I check it everyday. One more thing I promise, when I receive things and I collect them it pops up on the ALL thing and it is annoying. Overall I recommend it to people, please fix problems and reply developers!

PS, please add more dragons."

US	1	2018-11-30	4.1.1	Mmiloo w	Can’t reset	Unfortunately, doesn’t seem to be any way to reset your game if you want to start over from the beginning. Tried contacting for assistance but never heard back. Really a shame, I’d love to play this but it has an old game from a family member which I don’t want to jump into.
US	4	2018-11-30	4.1.1	Gee2Saucy	Great game ! I could only ask for one more thing.	This game is like a better version of dragon city . Better dragons , more creative gameplay, better graphics ,etc. It’s very fun and addicting and it’s debatebly my favorite iOS game . In my opinion this game is far ahead of its competition as far as “dragon breeding games “ but there is one thing other games such as dragon city have above it . Battling vs your friends . Me and my group of friends play dragon city as it is better in every other way in my personal opinion . Dragon breeding games have became popular at my school in a very short amount of time but I see there are multiple people with the dilemma of which game to choose . I have convinced some to download DML and wait for the update to come where we can battle our friends or at least clanmates in a live match sort of the same way as games like clash royale work .  But point is dml could be a much more popular game if it incorporated that feature . Doesn’t sound like a very big change, but trust me . I’m a teenage kid which are most likely the main audience for this sort of game and i can tell you a lot of the time I look for games to play vs my friends just because most teenage kids are very competitive and like entertaining games of the sort . I know it doesn’t sound like a big change but give it a chance and trust me it will do wonders .

US	5	2018-11-25	4.1.1	sasaseamore	Love this game!	I got so addicted to this game so fast! It’s really well made. Love the 3D effect. The only thing I would change is with the enchainment. It’s so hard to gain shards you actually need. I’d suggest being able to buy certain shards for coins or gems. I get frustrated when I never get the shards I actually need. All in all, this game is awesome! Keep up the good work!

It makes me annoyed you simply can’t start over on a new island/account. But everything about this game is amazing and I would give it a try.
US	4	2018-11-19	4.1.1	Yunyunwd	Very fun and entertaining	Its very fun and entertaing,but I do have a few complaints about the energy.
US	2	2018-11-18	4.1.1	DopezabUSA	Became total pay to win	"Now I’ve been playing this since I was young but when I left fo a while I came back to find it has completely changed. To hatch even a common dragon (say smoke dragon,) It takes approximately 45 minutes to hatch a smoke dragon. Before it’s about a few minutes. But the reason of the title is because it turned to P2W. Totally. The time has increased for hatching eggs so you’ll need a hell lot of gems. There’s no way I’m paying real money to this game. Gameloft, I know you got a lot of P2W games, and DML is like those games like Asphalt 8. So please stop. I would have given it 1 star but because of the great battles and cute dragons I would give you a better rating.

End of talk."

US	2	2018-11-16	4.1.1	jennarayetion	TOO MANY ADS!!	I’ve been playing DML for over a year. It’s fun and has so many cool, unique dragons. The only downside and absolutely annoyance is the overwhelming amount of ads. I can hardly play the game without being harassed by non stop pop-ups. The game is basically 80% ads. I have since taken a hiatus because it has become impossible to play or enjoy anymore.
US	5	2018-11-16	4.1.1	Hmturner341	Fun	I love that they’re are bosses
US	5	2018-11-15	4.1.1	Jadenewyo	Amazing Dragon game	At first I thought this is probably gonna be like all the other boring games I tried play. But no this one is actually Good! You can do all sorts of stuff from breeding to battles. I just wanna say to this creator or more, good job!

US	4	2018-11-11	4.1.1	MeowsieMeows	Please read my RADIENT dragon dissapierd	I would have rated this game 5 stars and I’ve played for more than 2 years I even have the badge and I even forgot my favorite RADIENT dragon but I stopped for a few months after I forgot about it then as I started playing I notice something missing my RADIENT DRAGON is not their and not even in my collections please tell me if it’s removed or why I don’t have it :c
US	1	2018-11-10	4.1.1	dareena56	GETTING REALLY FED UP WITH THIS BULLSH*T	USED TO LOVE THIS GAME, NOW ITS TURNED INTO ABSOLUTE BULLSH*T! EVERY TIME I TRY TO PLAY IT CRASHES AND I LOSE PROGRESS, INCLUDING TICKETS, THE AMOUNT OF ADS IS BAFFLING AND IT WONT LET ME TRANSFER MY ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER DEVICE! PLEASE ADRESS THESE ISSUES
US	1	2018-11-10	4.1.1	game hater and lover	Boooooooo!!!!	I hate the game it glitches every single second.it is also the slowest app I’ve ever played and the only dragons it has is ones that are money 💰💰💰💸💸💵💵😡😡😡😡😐
US	2	2018-11-10	4.1.1	😇😤spook	Over charged	Every time I purchase something for example 9.99 and get charged over 20.00 love the game but don’t appreciate getting ripped off. Has happened several times can anything be done about it????? Hate to stop playing been playing for quite awhile. I just think it’s bs being charged double. Just bought gems for the 9.99 special price and got charged over 21.00.
US	5	2018-11-09	4.1.1	Mega red Praneel	Make better dragons easer to get	See there’s a lot of bad dragons but good ones are harder to get   there to much you have to spend a lot of money to get one dragon so they should make it cheaper even with real money more new easy dragons to get that are good
US	3	2018-11-08	4.1.1	Watermelooooon wolf	Good game but	I love this game. I think it is amazing. But, I was looking at the dragons which you have to pay with real money and I mean a dragon for $100 is way to expensive. And the blue tickets, for 25 gems it gives you 1 ticket.  It’s a great game buuuuuuut, it’s a bit pricey :/
US	1	2018-11-07	4.1.1	ginaKline	Free spin not working	No free spin given after watching ads & cards too
US	4	2018-11-07	4.1.1	dareena56	Great game, just one minor issue...	I’ve been playing this game for almost a month now and I absolutely enjoy it, but I’ve noticed lately it’s been crashing a lot. And when I say a lot, I mean a lot a lot. Like almost every four minutes. Now I’m scared to battle because every time I’m halfway through a battle and the game crashes, the battle is still incomplete, but I loss an energy bar. Also, this might just be my phone, but every time I play my screen gets really hot and my battery drains fast. Please fix!
US	5	2018-11-06	4.1.1	Hammer head gone nice	Love this	I love raising each dragon and training them they are all so cute. I treat them as if they were my real life pets
US	2	2018-11-05	4.1.1	GeoffWHO79	Rip Off	"After playing this game for 3 years I am finally done. I have paid money to support the game along the way so I feel ripped off. Unless you have no life ie. school, work, or family you can only get ahead by spending cash or cheating.
I find it hard to believe that someone at level 60 can collect more money than me in a challenge (I was at level 110). You can't win at it. It's disappointing to say because the game is fun to play but unless you are independently wealthy or are a cheater they it will only frustrate you to play the game."
US	5	2018-11-04	4.1.1	kimberlypressley	Just... WOW!	I love ❤️ this game! Awesome 👏 job!
US	1	2018-11-04	4.1.1	cathykkkk	Got banned	This game banned me for no reason. They claimed I cheated which I do not know what I did and they won’t tell me

US	3	2018-11-03	4.1.1	wolfieNatalie77	Love the game but.....	I love this game but TOO MUCH COMMERCIALS! I just came into the game and there is already a commercial! Like wth!?! Plz fix this because I really love this game and play it everyday! When there is a commercial my game freezes and  I have to wait till the commercial shows up!

US	5	2018-10-31	4.1.1	mariea the wolf	Wow so fun	This game is so fun! I love breeding different dragons to get a new kind and I love that the dragons have DIFFERENT powers some dragon game donut have different powers or not even powers at all well that’s all i need to say bye
US	5	2018-10-31		unown pokemon	Awesome game	This game brought back memory’s I don’t know why all people say pay to win PATIENCE you don’t need to upgrade the hatchery or get the extra den just be patient people also it’s a free game what do you expect the best game in the whoooolllee world your not gonna get that it’s free but DML is gr8 and no one says otherwise
US	4	2018-10-30	4.1.1	dragontlm	Great.....but	The game itself is great... rating a 5, or higher if I could.  BUT... pop-up ads every two to three minutes? COME ON! Really cuts into the flow of the game, and reduces enjoyment DRAMATICALLY!
US	5	2018-10-29	4.1.1	dddddgjibfrghu	Dragon mania	Good game
US	5	2018-10-29	4.1.1	Aianka0702	Всем советую🌳🐉🐲🐉🌳	Очень крутая игра,мне она очень нравится.Я раньше в неё играла а сейчас заново начала,не могли бы подсказать можно ли мне всё что у меня было вернуть обратно просто очень хочется.И заранее спасибки😊
US	2	2018-10-28	4.1.1	jkapes	Not great and not terrible	"The game concept and general mechanics are ok. Leveling up your dragons without spending real dollars gets hard once they hit the mid 20s and accessing new content successfully without leveling them up is pretty much impossible so be prepared to rinse and repeat battles over and over while you grow food and collect scrolls. If you do choose to spend real dollars, everything is so ridiculously overpriced... as in who the heck is dumb enough to spend $100 US dollars for items that will take less than an hour to run through? So, it’s an ok game, kills time between activities. The real downside are the ads. I don’t mind games ads, it’s what makes these games “free” after all. Unfortunately the ads contracted in this game frequently crash the game, open random windows in the browser, and when they say the add will finish in 5, it really means until you force it to stop otherwise it’ll just keep going. Also, it gets old having ads pop up about every 3 minutes.
Added note: I stuck it out but I’m done. When they set it up so you can’t pass a boss due to their in game mechanics then put a timer on your attempts to keep you from fulfilling the quest line before the timer runs out on Sunday, I’m done. I don’t need a game in my life that’s set up to create fail after fail with no way to remedy it. So. Done."
US	5	2018-10-25	4.1.1	GMS!	Good game	I haven’t played for like 3 years but I like it because of the dragons I rated 5 stars because I just like being nice and because I just like the game and it is a good game it really is and also hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  world or a few people.
US	5	2018-10-25	4.1.1	XxIslandCatxX	Amazing	This is game is amazing. I love playing it with my friends. if you are thinking about buying this app you should.
US	4	2018-10-25	4.1.1	At jan	Fun but many purchases	There are many in-app purchases which is kind of a bummer, but it’s fine.
US	5	2018-10-25	4.1.1	Moonglow44	Dragon Mania Legends Suggestions	This game is 5/5 but it would be better if you came up a trade system for players to trade dragons
US	2	2018-10-23	4.1.1	Acro Monkey	Great game ruined by pop up adds	I don't mind watching adds to speed things along, unlock parts of the game, or after completing a few levels. This game has all of that AND tons of pop up adds. The game is great but you're constantly closing out pop ups. It gets old real quick.

I’ve been searching for a fantasy, build your own world kind of thing. And this takes the cake!!! I like the fact that there are many different challenges you can complete! I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for something new and full of dragons!

US	3	2018-10-11	4.1.1	Nissanator	Great game! But somethings wrong	This game is by far the best I have played. But like some other people have said, the big portion of the game is basically made up of in app purchases. I understand this may give the owner good money but yet again, the more you push people to buy people will start to leave. But otherwise it is a great game!
US	5	2018-10-11	4.1.1	Buttercup700	Great game for kids	"My 7 year old loves this game. Teaches him how to ""save"" money and wait to ""purchase"" things he wants in the game. Also teaches how to prioritize tasks. He loves the graphics and ""taking care of"" the dragons. This game was perfect to have on our long road trip from Michigan to Texas."
US	5	2018-10-11	4.1.1	Wolfy12	Great game!

After just a couple days of playing, I’ve already come to the point where it takes almost 24 hours to breed AND THEN another almost 24 hours to hatch the thing!! Since the whole point of the game is to get as many dragons as possible (there being more than 500), why does it take so long?!
Just not worth it."

I love this game I’ve had it for almost 3 to 4 years then my phone restarted and I want to go download it again because all of my apps are gone and my land was gone I couldn’t get it back and I didn’t know how I tried everything I could. So I would say it’s a great game overall. But I would love my new land back but I don’t see a way to do it. Also I wanted to say that my sister also lost her land and they told her nobody else has had this problem. But clearly other people have because now I am having the same problem!!

I mean, it’s pretty much related 2 dragon city, only dragons r different (of course) I’d say this game deserves 5 stars for its entertainment, 5 stars for epic fights, and 5 stars for kewl and awesum dragons.

US	5	2018-09-28	4.0.0	WyFychan	Lots of fun!	"So far this has been a great game! It has run smoothly for me, accept for the free wheel. Sometimes the videos just won’t load. 
The tutorial is good and easy to follow. The last couple games I played, made by different people, didn’t seem to get how to do that. It is refreshing to not have the stress at the start of a game for once.
There is such a wide range of dragons, silly, cute, cool, I love it. I can’t wait to discover more of them!"

US	3	2018-09-27	4.0.0	OMG INLOVE	Kinda?	I really am into this game but the problem is that the eggs take long and so does the breeding and I have no gems 💎 maybe you can give me a free ad? That’s the spirit!

And I am like........

US	5	2018-09-20	4.0.0	Rosie Hurd	A big glitch but amazing game!	Fist this game is amazing but there is a huge glitch so if you go to a dragon that you will get from arena that you don’t have press the button that says arena then you will pick your dragon but when you start the battle you can’t press of course you can press the element and kill the dragons you can’t see them you can’t miss you can’t get a perfect hit and I just don’t like it so if you could fix that that would be great anyways keep up the good work!
US	5	2018-09-19	4.0.0	🤣🌺🍀	The best	Omg, I love this game! You get to hatch dragons, play with them, and battle with them! If you don’t have this game, get it! Although it is a little glitchy it’s still the best! Get it!
US	3	2018-09-19	4.0.0	Acro Monkey	Really great game too many adds	The game is great. Similar to Monster Legends but filled with awesome dragons and great mini games. Really love it. There's way too many pop up adds though. I don't mind adds after a lvl every now and then. Or adds for gems. But pop up randomly and constantly gets old quick.

It’s so frustrating having to wait till everything disappears to be able to collect anything else. Please please fix this. I love this game just not that.

US	2	2018-09-04	4.0.0	PoohBear39	Too Many Ads	While I understand the option to watch ads to skip things or the occasional ad after something is ending or right as I open the game. However what I do not understand is random ads popping up as I’m playing the game for absolutely no reason. Sometimes you can just click the ‘X’ and immediately send it away but sometimes it’s a full 30 second ad I never asked for. I’m pretty sure this game makes plenty off of in app purchases and voluntary ad watches so I don’t see why we have to be forced to go through ads randomly. Fun game when I’m not busy sending away unwanted ads

US	4	2018-09-01	4.0.0	nicefriendlygirl	Time consuming	I love this game very much but this game is very time consuming that it takes a long time to breed, hatch, plant and refill fighting points. Plus when it does it need so many diamonds just to upgrade the hatching area I think it should only be 50. Otherwise I love this game fully
US	5	2018-09-01	4.0.0	a crazy cat lover🐱🦁	WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD!?	"If you are like I don't know... GET IT. Look if you don't like it then delete it.

Oh and if the creators are reading this then thanks so much! Suggestion- please make a permanent kitty dragon. Or cat dragon in the shape similar to boiling or agent. Thanks 🙏 

P.s to new people DO NOT WASTE YOUR GEMS!!!! Do not waste your resources use them sparingly please. Save your wallet from the gems."

US	5	2018-08-30	4.0.0	Indigenous50	Needed too much storage	I had been playing this game for almost a year but the latest patch required more space to download. I deleted all apps I was never using and it still would not download the latest patch. I have a little under 7 GB free so not sure what the app was looking at. I have spent money on gems before and seems like a waste now. Was a decent game before this last patch.
US	5	2018-08-30	4.0.0	Shakin' Bacon Kitty	Wowz!	I've tried many dragon games, but this is the BEST! This game has shorter timers, funner (which is totally a word) fighting, and just amazing dragons!

US	5	2018-08-28		Diamondcatlover4life	Awesome.	"Really good game. It’s easy to earn any currency (even diamonds.) and so fun to play. Some suggestions are add a chat maybe (so you can say how awesome each other’s dragons are!) and maybe a way to trade dragons? Like, if you had a friend that wanted a candy dragon and you wanted a leaf dragon? I have only one problem. It keeps saying it needs wifi to play but my iPod says I have full wifi. Please fix! Also more energy faster or maybe you could get boosts that made energy faster?
I love that you get prizes too! I’m hatching an agent dragon! Awesome game otherwise! Love it 😻!"

US	1	2018-08-18	3.9.0	🐧🦄🌈🐧🐧🦄🌈🦄	Too expensive	Everything in the game costs loads of gems and gems are so hard to get and even if you do buy them it’s like $100 for 10000 gems witch will only get you like 2 divine dragons. Such a RIPOFF?😡 oh yah but dragons are cute, I guess
US	3	2018-08-16	3.9.0	Yukaiyeen	Great game, but ridiculously expensive	"Everything in the game is really expensive, and with having to clear out natural things likes rocks and trees for upwards of 30,000 coins, it’s hard to progress. Not to mention almost everything uses gems, which are easy to obtain in very small amounts. 
It makes the game hard to enjoy, and not to talk about the 19 hour waiting periods. It’s ridiculous, but to be fair it’s super fun and creative. And I personally like it more than other dragon games like this."
US	5	2018-08-16	3.9.0	Cherry_Blast	The videos don’t load	Every time I watch an add for Ottos lotto it doesn’t load. The same thing happens when I click to watch a video to get 30 seconds off my breeding. I really hope this is fixed it’s very annoying.
US	5	2018-08-15	3.9.0	-------- bullet	This is one of my favorite games but the egeption update/event should go	)(
US	4	2018-08-15	3.9.0	TheEquineGamer	Cool game!	The graphics in this game are super cool! I love all the different dragons and I think they’re so cute. The only thing I don’t like is that the breeding and hatching and stuff take so long and cost so many gems to speed up, so half the time I’m waiting a day to get one dragon, and then another to upgrade its habitat.
US	3	2018-08-15	3.9.0	odindiodokdnd	Last Update	Ever since the last update it’s been more fun than it usually is however it has been way more glitchy with so many new bugs. The ads tend to slow down or crash the game, and sometimes it refuses to completely load no matter how many times I reopen or restart it
US	5	2018-08-15	3.9.0	Band Nerd 13	Great game!❤️	Amazing game with fun and creative ideas! Though some things you have to work for, if you don’t want to pay money, it is definitely worthwhile. Thank you game loft for making this game free! ;)
US	5	2018-08-15	3.9.0	UnwrittenT	Amazing game. You'll enjoy it; a different experience.	Favorite dragon app so far. It doesn't have an overwhelming amount of ads/bundles smacking you in the face or clogging up the sidebar with no toggle feature. I love the graphics and being able to interact with each dragon individually. That's unique to this game. It feels personal. The only thing that could be improved is to move the screen record button elsewhere, as I 9/10 times hit that instead when I'm trying to close a box. Ads to speed things up/get free prizes occasionally don't load/refresh without and needs the app to restart to work, or you give up. Other than those minor quirks which can easily be fixed, this is a solid game. 10/10.

US	5	2018-08-12	3.9.0	Dog lover 1357	A Small Request for Game makers?	Heeeeey! Sup. Dragon Mania Legends fan here. Just warning you, you WILL get addicted to this game. Anyways, small request for the game makers. In the next update, PLEASE make the wait times shorter? I mean, 15 hours for a dragon to be hatched is enough to discourage someone from playing. And maybe make the things that cost real money also available for a large amount of in-game gold. That’s all I have to say. Great game!!! I’m totally addicted.

US	2	2018-08-06	3.9.0	Afterburnr	Enemy Scaling	"I have been playing this game for a month now and I have reached level 22. During my playtime, I have realized that the enemies in the side quests and special events (Egypt) scale will always scale higher then your dragons’ levels. For example, I had 3 level 15 dragons with around level 1 to 2 abilities. However, for the Egyptian event fights, I was matched against a level 17,18, and 19. My dragons pretty much got destroyed. This also happens in the side quest areas although to a lesser extent to my knowledge. My problem with this makes it feel as there is no real progression system with enemies getting stronger with you getting stronger also. I’m not sure being max level will fix this problem. 
/ps/ the campaign does not have horrible scaling at least"

It gets boring after a few weeks because it needs too much TIME. I don’t know if I just got the type of game that wasn’t for me (I am very impatient) but it needs TOO MUCH TIME. Overall though, it’s a pretty fun game. But can you please fix those problems???

US	4	2018-07-30	3.9.0	SunServalLily	Please Read, Creators!! These Need To Be Changed!	"Hello! I think DML is an amazing game. Just a few things to make the game better! Please consider!!

First of all, gems are extremely hard to get, making it harder for players to get items to truly enjoy the game. Please make it easier to obtain the gems like when you win a battle for the championships, you could get a small pay of 2-10 gems.

Also, to go along with it, there are so many in-app purchases that insures that you can only really enjoy the game if you send a lot of money on the game. And since everything is ‘worth’ so much gems/coins, it goes away so quickly. Please make the in-app purchases less expensive or make gems/gold easier to get. 

Please understand that I’m not demanding these changes, but these issues are going to get a lot of players (well, if they are anything like me XD) to stop spending money on the game. In my opinion, it’s better to sell things cheap so that so many people will buy it. Thanks and please remember that I am not demanding anything.

US	4	2018-07-30	3.9.0	Qu1nnTheDmlPlayer	Switching Facebook accounts & and given fair opponents to battle with	"DML is really fun and I like how you made it so that there are clans so we can actually play with real people instead being by yourself. The events and dragon of the month or week make it more fun since your actually having a goal or target to complete instead of just battling, feeding, enchanting your dragons, etc. One thing the game could improve is switching between Facebook accounts. One time I wanted to play my regular account in dml on my new phone, but I accidentally connected to my other Facebook account, and I thought I could just quickly switch back into the Facebook account that had my regular dml account, but when I disconnected and connected again, all I could do was connect back to the Facebook accounts I accidentally logged in to or log out. I tried everything to try to get the my other account such as deleting dml & Facebook, etc. nothing worked so I had to use another device and this one would never have my account again, so my suggestion is to be able to switch Facebook accounts. 
     And then the other problem is that in the Arena & enchanted battle leagues, you’re mostly matched with players 10-15 levels above you, and rarely matched with players at your level, making it impossible to get to the top places such as 1-10. So I suggest that your matched with players at your level so it’s actually a fair battle instead of instantly being KO’d & losing.
     But DML is still a great game, but it could be better with these improvements."

US	5	2018-07-22	3.9.0	CABYLC88	Awesome Game!	This game is one of the best games I have ever played. I love dragons and I play like every day. I am really impressed with the quality of the animation and story. I have a few recommendations though. The first one is make legendary dragons just a little easier to get. Lower the price by just a little bit and maybe make them easier to breed too. Also, this might be a little hard to add, but if there could be a thing where for about two thousand gems you could create your own dragon. If you do add this idea, you should check to make sure it doesn’t have an inappropriate name. Thank you for reading!
US	5	2018-07-22	3.9.0	Irieone311	Addicting	"Fun game but I do have a few complaints and suggestions. When watching videos for extra gems, enchantment materials, cards, 8/10 times it tells me that my wifi is too slow and will not play the video and my wifi is NOT too slow. This is the only game that I have that issue with. Also, It is too expensive to buy epics, legends, etc. especially the legends, and, it takes waaaaay to many tries to try and breed them, example: Ive tried to breed a pixie dragon more than 20 times so far and have not gotten it yet, (not exaggerating, over 20 times!) I still play though bc its fun. Suggestion: Wish u could interact w the players more i.e., like if there was a ""sale board"" where you could buy, sell, trade dragons and items between players, Selling any doubles or requesting things you need and buying from players instead of the game. It would b an excellent feature, I have talked to a bunch of players who agree. 
But...all in all it is a fun game w cool graphics and original dragon themes. Addicting"

US	2	2018-07-21	3.9.0	Gemless player	Tl;dr: MAKE GEMS EASIER TO GET	You’ll see a lot of reviews saying this, and it’s true. It’s a nice game, but it requires WAY too many “gems”. Now, if you’ve played a lot of “village” style games, you know this all too well, but you must be thinking, then just have the patience to wait for the food, watch ads to get gems, etc. However this game has almost made it impossible to succeed without paying for gems. Watching ads for gems gets you 1 at a time, whereas something like skipping 3 hours on a dragon egg costs 25 gems (food and breeding have even crazier pricing). Even $0.99 or $5 won’t get you far in this game. On top of that, the different modes, especially the “league” mode, matches you up with impossible pairings, saying you have 3 level 16 (because getting beyond there takes a week worth of food growing) against 4 level 25 or 30 dragons. And again, if you want to actually be able to skip wait time on anything, you have to put an investment of $10 or $25 for it to be worth it, and over $50 if you actually want to get ahead in the game. Overall, gameloft, you wondered why I’m not satisfied? You’ve made a game that’s fun to play... for anyone with $50. I’m all for paying $5 every now and then, but its not even worth it. Lower the costs for waiting times for food, increase the food yield, or SIGNIFICANTLY increase the gems in your gem packs, then this will get 5 stars, hands down.
US	4	2018-07-21	3.9.0	JuniorTurnip	Super fun game!	I Had so much fun with the game so far. The only problem is, why do you have to be thirteen and up? Like, is it because of the breeding? We learn about mating and reproduction in fifth grade science, you know. So 10 and 11 year old should also be able to play this game. And this is BASICALLY dragon city, but I prefer this more. And dragon city doesn’t need you to be thirteen. I hope you consider this or tell me if you have to be thirteen for another reason.

US	3	2018-07-21	3.9.0	ShayShay2023	! Please Read !	"If you don’t want to read the whole thing:
It’s a fine game, just buggy and takes a while to progress. Now on to the full review!

So.. Here’s the thing. I really like this game, but I’m not sure if I should keep it. The graphics are good, and so is the concept, which was done over again by a few other companies. There are SO many dragons to collect, and that’s all well and good, but there’s some key problems that make me wonder whether or not it can merit 4 stars.
One, it crashes out on me from right when I open it, to 10 to 20 minutes after.
Two, it’s really slow! You have to wait till Level 25 to join a clan, so a few weeks! I’m only on 15, and the game itself is already getting old.
Three, It doesn’t let me watch ads for gems or to skip time.
I don’t know why, but it’s just... Blegh. It’s been done before! It requires internet for everything, it takes up a good amount of space that not everyone has, and, remember, it’s really slow! I have clash of clans and fallout shelter, so I’m used to slow, but this is a different kind of game, more similar to candy crush, requiring energy, and a lot of work and time! It’s not a good game when you just want to chill for a few minutes during break, and it’s just overall bland.
Game Dev, if you’re reading this, I’d suggest that first, you take out energy, but slightly buff all of the dragons, and lower the likelihood of misses, making progression through the campaign more of a test of skill then one of luck and energy!
Second, recommend it as a game for little kids. Because my little brother and his friends have a wonderful time playing it, since they only have 45 minutes of screen time a day, and they enjoy grouping together and playing it, or just playing pretend “Dragon Mania.” (My brother likes pretending to be the MELON BOSS.)
Third, take out some dragons. Don’t take away people’s precious dragons, just stop putting so many combos in the store! It’s overwhelming for most people!
And the all-important Fourth, lower the time it takes for dragons to hatch and breed, actually, just lower the time for everything!
And maybe reduce the level required to have a clan at say... 15.
Dragon ML is a pretty good game, and Merits Three and a Half Stars, however, I won’t be keeping it, given I have 5 available slots for games, so I’m pretty picky."
US	5	2018-07-21	3.9.0	Ildamiri	Wait what happens if you get a dragon that’s not for you lvl	So I won the event that you get a free epic storm dragon 🐉 and I waited it to hatch for a day and it’s for lvl 25 I’m on lvl 18 and it let me breed it anyways so I think it’s a glitch but I like it and that matters PLEASE DON’T REMOVE IT 🐉🐉🐉

US	5	2018-07-19	3.9.0	Magiccaterpillar	Really really cool	I think this game is really cool and a must-have for anyone who likes dragons or even just an adventure game. It has lots of content, contests, competition, creativity and so much more! While I do really like this game and give it a 5 star, there are a few downsides to the game as well as tweaks to make it better. First of all, it takes up so much storage which I guess you can't blame them, but you have to keep downloading until all your storage is gone. Second and probably most importantly they need to add trading. It would be incredible and make the game so much better if we could trade not only dragons but enchantment crystals too. Third, it's not as bad as some apps, but is is pay to win. There are bundles for dragons you don't have, lots of it is gems, which to get a lot of them, you need to pay. There are even some dragons that you have to buy to obtain and you can't get them anywhere else. But all around its a great game. I want to see improvements but I'm also very happy with what is here. It's important to have fun. Have fun dragonmasters!!! 🐲🐉🔥
US	5	2018-07-19	3.9.0	Relaaaaaaa	Amazing App!	This app is overall, my favorite app. Same goes for my brother. The game is quite addicting, and when you're bored, the game is fun to use often. The animation is very nice. I thing Gameloft did a good job.
US	3	2018-07-19	3.9.0	BARDMAX	Great Game But...	I really like this game because I think the graphics are great, the ability to breed dragons is engaging, but I feel like there is one big problem. It takes ENTIRELY too long to harvest food to level up your dragons. I feel like something has to change for the food harvesting times and amounts.

US	5	2018-07-18	3.9.0	BreeMariee920	In a serious love hate relationship	I am not one to play games... especially on my phone. However my five year old is absolutely obsessed with dragons and we stumbled upon this game as a result. It started as a simple occasional playing however I have now devoted sooooo much time to this game and I’m embarrassed to admit the amount of money I’ve put in improving my dragons so they can be stronger and better. I love playing this so much that I have actually told my daughter she cannot play mine anymore and she had to get her own. (You guys have to understand she was wasting all my diamonds! 💎😂😂😂). Long story short give this game a try... meanwhile I’ll just casually start a go fund me page so that I can keep up with addictions and adult responsibilities.
US	5	2018-07-18	3.9.0	N/A1031	Wonderful one suggestion	Can you please add a custom character that you can pick and do things
US	4	2018-07-18	3.9.0	BATRSMY01	Love the game but...	I love this game a lot, it’s so much fun to hatch dragons and breed dragons. One thing that bothers me, are the ads. Way too many of them, sometimes I accidentally click on them and then I get sent to safari which is highly annoying. Another thing is the time it takes to hatch and breed dragon eggs. Some of the times are acceptable like some take a day or eleven hours, like, why do I wanna wait that long? It would be better if the time span was way shorter. Second, it costs so much to clear objects from an island, it’s annoying. For a small pond, 30,000. Like no. But overall, besides those little things, the game is fun and I enjoy playing it.

Add more types of dragons like poison, leather and MUCH a more dragons, how about for new dragons you give them a third move... these are just ideas I LOVE THIS GAME. I persuaded 5 of my friends to download it. But the ads like the goldfish one is getting repetitive and it bothers me a lot... but I still love this game and getting the dragons of the week are so fun and I just love this game and I wish this game could get a lot more love
US	5	2018-07-14	3.8.1	ajrubie	Amazing game	I love the fact u earn money by fighting Vikings and then buying dragons! My champion dragon costed a lot but when he gets trained (awesome feature) he gets to be worth the price. Everything is really awesome, I just have a quick suggestion... maybe lower the dragon and pack prices, don’t make people wait and spend gems to upgrade and buy, and make 3 spots for the starter nursery, because I’m doing breeding experiments all the time and I don’t have space to put the eggs, finally, make there an unlimited amount of habitats to build. But the game overall is amazing, those suggestions don’t really bother me but I just wanted to make sure you just hear me out! (Hear me developer and buyers)
US	5	2018-07-14	3.8.1	EnderGamingStudio	My Suggestions	I think you should add more elements like spectrum or something. I also think you should add an exchange feature which would be like 100 coins to 1 gems, that would be helpful for people who have a lot of money but have trouble getting gems!

US	5	2018-07-12	3.8.1	Hannah1564	Just having some issues	I recently switched from Samsung to iPhone and had DML on my Samsung for years and now I can’t get my progress to switch over. I signed into Facebook in attempt to make the transfer easy but I’m having no such luck. This is my favorite game and I don’t want to start from the beginning. Please make it so doing the multiple devices feature works easier. And if so please get back and help me out! I love this game and recommend it to everyone!
US	5	2018-07-12	3.8.1	DecemberDragonsSS	Wow!	This game is so much fun! I love the community too!

US	5	2018-07-10	3.8.1	Bonnieiswatching	Spectacular	I am very new to this game, but so far it has been stellar! I love the battle mechanics, they’re creative. The dragons are really cute. By far the best dragon game I’ve ever played! Good job and keep up the good work! 👌🏻👍🏻
US	5	2018-07-09	3.8.1	air line rocky	Nice	Awesome sauce 👍👍
US	5	2018-07-09	3.8.1	OnVenus	I’ve been playing this game for over a year	"It’s one of my all time favorite games for sure. The animations and graphics are amazing, and each dragon is unique. There’s so much to do in this game! There’s almost ALWAYS an event going on, and you can decorate your islands any time you want! You can also battle on the campaign map, arena, dungeon, enchantment league, or mines on the campaign map. 

The gems in this game are also pretty easy to get, which is nice if you don’t want to spend real money on buying any. Gems can also be used to buy food, and gold, which is another plus. 

Then there are clans, one of my favorite parts of the game. There are special clan events, and if complete tasks, you earn points. Points can be used to buy card packs, and activation of your clan dragon.

You can upgrade almost everything! Habitats, the Academy, your dragons, and you can get more islands too! 

However, after I unlocked most of the shadow dragons (the last element) I lost motivation soon after for the game. I know I just explained everything I love about this game, but I lost motivation for everything in the game. I just did it so many times...It wasn’t fun anymore. Yes, I still enter the game daily to retrieve my prize, but that’s about all I do. Collect gold, leave the game. I wish there was another element, or something else BIG that would come to the game where I could regain my interest. 

Thank you!"
US	3	2018-07-09	3.8.1	Carl's Power	I VERY much love this game but...	I love this game a lot it has a lot of event and there are a lot of update coming out every day but a thing that pisses me of is that why is there so much freaking ads popping out of nowhere and it is ruining the game for me so please fix this problem or I won't be playing
US	5	2018-07-09	3.8.1	jsjs drdd	Monster mania legends	Good game me and my friends and brother love this game and keep doing what you do best and my name is Roman
US	5	2018-07-09	3.8.1	Sqisheylongtail	Love It!	"The game is so mush cooler than some games. This is fun!

Update: Okay, I still love the game, but every time I’ve tried to get on it today it’s been crashing and won’t let me play. I’m not sure if it has something to do with me, or if it’s just not gonna work today(July 8th)
I dunno. Can you look into that please?"
US	5	2018-07-09		Katiya N. ;)	Great game	This game is really good because you can just keep playing and playing and it is really addictive that’s why I rate this game 5 stars!
US	5	2018-07-08	3.8.1	Ryan Hasselmeier	Its awesome	This game lets u play and breed dragons and fight and level up your beast. U will be happy of what that game does ❤️
US	5	2018-07-08	3.8.1	alextheadventuegirl	Best game ever!!!!	If you have a kid that’s really young and I meAn young. This game lets you use freind codes so you can freind freinds or family only(real life people you know)this is great for kids
US	1	2018-07-08	3.8.1	The_Well_Unknown	This is the worst thing in games	At the start it was such a beautiful exiting game but then this happened... so i got to level 44 in it and all the sudden BOOM! Your save is gone forever .. I tried so hard several times to get my save back or at least  know what happened and i just wanted to throw all my anger in this review although I didn’t curse lucky.. at the End just thanks for wasting my time.

US	4	2018-07-04	3.8.1	🤓😜🤗	Overall Good Game	Really fun game! You can get money and gems quite easily! Dragons are really cool to! However the adds are really really REALLY BAD!!!! PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT ADDS!!!! There is an X button on the adds but you have to click for (no exaggeration) 5 minutes before it goes away!!!! Adds come up even if you don’t click on like an add vid button so you can get a free gem or something they pop up when you’re trying to do something!  Please fix the ads issue! Otherwise this is a fun game.
US	3	2018-07-04	3.8.1	mcmcmc413	Love the app, but...	"I love this app, but no more ads! It’s a kids app, so why does it have ads? Please consider erasing ads.
Oh, and I also wish that when your waiting for your egg to be ready to hatch (which takes like 6 hours) you should let their be a choice to sell it, because sometimes I know what it might turn out to be, so I kinda wanna skip it if I already have it. 
Otherwise, the app is awesome sauce!!! 😀😄😜😛
P.S.— Please consider making a dragon that looks like a star spangled banner maybe, because it would look kinda cool to me and probably lots of others!"

It gets stuck or doesnt open the game when your in the loading or welcome screen. Like it keeps loading. I have to quit the game and restart it everytime. And its not my internet since it always work like the 2nd or 3rd time"

US	5	2018-07-03	3.8.1	binosaurlover	I LOVE THIS GAME	Rlly it’s just perfect I’ve never seen another dragon I like but this there’s nothing wrong with it it’s the battles are easy and there’s events u get to feed grow and make dragons stronger when I just played this game I just then knew it would have been in my top 3 fav games so I think this game is a win and who ever made this game should make more games like this I think it would be much fun and a lot of people would love it that’s why I gave this game a 5 star it’s great.
US	3	2018-07-03	3.8.1	mja160	Too many adds	The game is not bad i do like it but i hate the ads you can be about to feed your dragon or about to battle and it forces you to see an ad i hate that so much. I understand it can fund the game but it gets me so angry i wind up not buying just because of the irritating adds. Also there is never enough food to feed your dragon the amount of time to get food is ridiculous so is the amount of coins you have to use just to get food the good things are there are alit of events good dragons and it is fun if you put the ads out of it

US	5	2018-07-02	3.8.1	Animal Wisprer	Great Game!	I think this game is the best I love Dragons and want one as my pet in real life! This is the only good Dragon game other dragon games are very bad in my opinion. By: Animal Wisperer

US	5	2018-07-01	3.8.1	breederguy	Awesome!	This game is so awesome. I like how many kinds of dragons there are. Great game😁😆😎
US	5	2018-07-01	3.8.1	Bob17929	Great game but one change	"I love dragon mania legends but I think there should be one change. Just this morning I was fighting a battle in the dungeon and I lost. Then it came to me. I thought that having to waves of dragons is not fair to the players of dragon mania legends. If you could fix that and make it one wave of stronger dragons that would make me very happy. Thank you.

P. S. There are not too many more ads on my game of dragon mania legends. I know a lot of people complain about ads but I don’t because there’s not that many more on my game. I don’t know if you fixed that but are used to be having a lot of goldfish go karts ads and I was getting sick of it. Thank you if that was your doing(taking away the ads) and this game is doing very well for me, I love it!"
US	5	2018-07-01	3.8.1	Jaisalyn	Great game	I didn’t think this game was gonna be that good but it’s addicting especially once you start getting more powerful dragons. One thing though. There should be a feature where if you already have a dragon and you breed another one of it that you don’t want but your friend doesn’t have it you can gift it to them.
US	4	2018-07-01	3.8.1	Readyforsummer	Awesome Game!!!	Awesome game, but the ads are extremely annoying. They come up frequently when you’re trying to do something and prevent you from playing. Way too many ads that show up way too often!!!!! I wish there was a way to buy the game to rid myself of the ads.

US	5	2018-06-30	3.8.1	M24SME	Good game! But a problem	I really enjoy playing this game, it’s really fun to play but, I noticed something happening. In the morning I was able to play without any problem but now I’m not even able to play anymore. I log in and I enter the game, then it says connecting to dragolania then takes me back to the home screen. It repeated this over and over again. I know it’s the game because my WiFi is fine, I restarted my phone over and over again. I like the game but I can’t even get on anymore, there’s no update I checked. Please help.

US	3	2018-06-27	3.8.0	WillNokocho	The Ads are too intrusive!	The only problem I have with this game is the ads. The ads pop up way to frequent and right when you are about to click on something, so you end up clicking on the ad and being redirected to your browser. I uninstalled for that reason alone.
US	4	2018-06-27		KBReviews	Fun but doesn't hold	Needs to add some more direct battles with others.  I played this game a lot for awhile and then slowly lost that motivation.  It can become very repetitive and sometimes you wonder what's the point?

US	4	2018-06-26	3.8.0	CutieGamer92105	Dragon Mania Legends is amazing!	I enjoy playing this game, except quite often a Goldfish Go-Kart advertisement pops up. There is an exit button, but I can’t get it to work. So I can’t exit the commercial even when it ends. I don’t know if this is only on my device, but if possible I would love it if this was fixed somehow. Thanks for reading!

Ads no longer crash the game, I enjoy the interactive ads the best! I don’t always play this game but when I do it’s not usually a quick check in. Thank you DML makers!

And to those who think you need to spend real money to play this game - you are not playing right. I have spent $0 real money and I receive about 8-10M every couple hours from my dragons. This is a great game, you should download."

The only thing is that I can’t finish with 1st prize every time there is an event! Please fix this so it’s easier to win that. Also, a new dragon idea: the Mimic dragon! It has a new attack called “Mimic” that lets it attack with the same attack that the enemy uses for one turn. If you like this idea, please do it! Thank you!

Yours truly, OmegaDragons321"

You can literally be tapping to collect gold or food and bam pop up ad that you just clicked on and it opens up your web browser. Overall fun game but the ads ruined it and i ended up deleting the game because of this it gets super annoying and very frustrating.

US	4	2018-06-20	3.8.0	Lindy Lou 1959	New Update	I gave Dragon Mania a 3 based on the new update.  The new dragons are a nice touch but hope they are breedable.  By looking at the book of dragons last night it looks like they are all LTD.  I like the fact of a new breeding den which is something we have asked for a very long time.  The fact that it is $4.99 a month stinks.  All the other games have it as an item you purchase with gems or game cash.  The slots in the dragon storage facility are out way to high, really $100M for one slot is utterly ridiculous.  I play your game more than the rest but it looks like you guys are starting to be a money game like the other ones.  I will not purchase the extra breeding den for $4.99 a month due to reasons stated above.  Very disappointed to see the game headed as purchasing game and ruin a fun game for many.
US	5	2018-06-20	3.8.0	saphirasam	Not a gamer	I am definitely not one to play a game more than a few days and get tired of it. This game,however, has me checking it daily even if it just to pet the dragons!
US	4	2018-06-20	3.7.0	Band Nerd 13	Love it but..... :(	I love this game it is really well put together. The graphics are great, the content is interesting and fun, and the dragons are sooo creative! :) only one issue... I understand that the developers need to have ads, and I’m cool with watching a twenty to thirty second ad or two, but every time I get the ad that comes up the most, it refuses to let me get out of it and just stays on the “please download” page. I really love this game but I can’t do anything if I can’t exit an ad. Please let me know what I can do to fix this! Thank you! 🙃

Plus if you miss a day you won’t lose your progress on reward levels! I hope you enjoy this great app and that your dragons think so two!

US	5	2018-06-16	3.7.0	bird and horse lover	PERFECT	I just love this app and it makes me think about when I was little I used to love dragons and I still do to this day.If you like dragons or any mistical creatures like unicorns or monsters this is the PERFECT game for you
US	5	2018-06-15	3.7.0	CashPirate19	This is a really great game!👍🏾	Great graphics,easy to play.
US	2	2018-06-15	3.7.0	Selina E.	AMAZING APP!!	Just to stat with I don't usually write reviews but this one is so much fun I just had to. DML is my most favorite app of all time. I never run out of things to do. I absolutely love this app, I play it every day. I would highly recommend it. There is one thing that I don't like though, there are way to many adds. I will click on something and then an ad will pop up and my iPad will think I pressed on it. It will then bring me to the App Store or a weird website.
US	5	2018-06-14	3.7.0	pugs are perfect	🤩I love it🤩	This game is great and I enjoy it very much. The dragons are so cute when they’re babies. I thought it would be very cool if there were dragons from other references. I mean like dragons that have a design from a like a TV show or an anime. Naruto would be really cool. All the hokage dragons. 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
US	5	2018-06-14	3.7.0	glitches while recording	ADS	Everything in this game is excellent and fun. ECEPT this one ad every 5 minutes shows up on my screen and I can’t exit out of it. I have to swipe it out of my apps just to get back in.
US	5	2018-06-14	3.7.0	MrAntiSocial666	Love it	My best friend showed me the game and i’ve been enjoying it so far since yesterday.
US	5	2018-06-13	3.7.0	Coppus	The best breeding game! But...	Why does everything have to be so hard to get? I downloaded this game yesterday and I like it, but it’s so, so, so, hard to earn gems and coins; and the things I need cost like, 1,000 or 25,000 gems. And you can only get them by completing challenges. And, YOU NEED LIKE, 40,000 gems to do a requirement FOR the challenges. I love this game, but please think about the gem problem. (I am NOT paying $20.00 for only ten gems)!
US	5	2018-06-13	3.7.0	its sara	The best game ever	I was watching a video in YouTube video because all my games are boring and then an ad of this game appeared And I was like “ok let’s try this” and you will not regret playing it
US	5	2018-06-12	3.7.0	narthi	Thank you for the gameplay	Caution:game is very additive
US	5	2018-06-12	3.7.0	Emmz W	Love the game but it has its issues	Love this game so much but it wont stop make dragons and objects grey with question marks over them and it will say “download content” even though i have downloaded it multiple times almost everyday
US	5	2018-06-11	3.7.0	cade the babe	Bet boi	Amazing game
US	4	2018-06-10	3.7.0	Wolfcrazygirl1	Love It but a few probs 😕	Personally I LOVE the game but I think everything costs too much money in the game. For example when I wanna clear trees I go to tap on one and it cost 16,000!  And the dragons only give u 1000 coins per HOUR! and when I get the coins I have to spend it on dragon food or building something like a tower to lvl up dragons or upgrading a building. One more thing that bothers me is I think u should have more energy to start out with to go into battles. One last thing is I think u should not have to wait so long on events to battle. My example is on the Turf War I go to battle dragons and when I complete one battle I have to wait 2 hours before I can battle more dragon. Other than this I thing it is GREAT! I love all the hard work u put into these games.  Ty for reading this!😋😋😋
US	4	2018-06-10	3.7.0	billithekat	Nice but...	Don’t get me wrong i love this game but sometimes it makes me load every objet and 🐉 dragon 🐉.............by the way it’s annoying 😢😩😫🤯😳😒😕😖😣😔😟

US	4	2018-06-10	3.7.0	sddxgcx	why i only gave it 4 stars	the reason i only gave it 4 stars is because there are too many ads
US	3	2018-06-09	3.7.0	Nunia buisnuss	Please make a send to all button!!	The game is fine, company is super greedy though. But please make a send to all button for sending gifts to friends!!! It's so annoying having to scroll for ages!!
US	1	2018-06-08	3.7.0	MmeMadd	Freemium at it’s worst	Even if you’re a paying player you’re constantly bombarded with adds, they’re super stingy with the ingame currency and to top it off the game has to “load additional content” for 5 minutes every day.
US	1	2018-06-08	3.7.0	Guinevere s	Downloading Additional Data	"Let's get straight to the point. Every time I go back into the game is wants me to redownload additional data. This includes the Earth Dragon thing, one of my own dragons, and some of the dragons that can be bought in the store. They just turn gray with a question mark. Wama, my Ceremony Dragon, has to be ""downloaded"" every time I get back in. It also wants over 100 more MB's of data, when I choose download all. It's quite frustrating. It's never happened before, yet suddenly I've got so many things to download! PLEASE FIX!

Update: I thought it had stopped, but no. Today I logged in to see Wama and Echo, that bat dragon that you could get by logging in for a certain amount of days, were once again turned into question marks. It never happened before, and now it gets VERY annoying to have to ""redownload"" things in the game that I shouldn't need to redownload! I don't even know why this is happening, and when I hit to download all, it has so much MB's to download, i'm not sure my device even has that much space! Fix your game!"

there is a lot of ads but I don’t mind"
US	5	2018-06-04	3.7.0	tkbby29	Absolutely love but..	I love dml and have been playin it for about 3-4 years now. It's by far the best game in the entire App Store. My only issue is why do I have to download 211mb of downloadable content literally every time I open the app?? It's literally the same content every time. And if I don't then I can't see my dragons because they have question marks on them. Please fix. Rated 5 stars because this game is the best minus that one issue.

US	2	2018-06-02	3.7.0	Kim_Diesel	Good game but company is very greedy	"The game can be fun, but the micro purchases are hardly worth it. Compared to other highly rated games I’ve played such as Monster Legends, the gems purchases are very expensive and you need hundreds - thousands of gems to do very small things. Don’t waste your money on purchases on this game. Just download some other games and play this one after a few hours has past.
Even the events can get very aggravating. If you have to collect items to advance, you will have to wait hours to collect another item. All the events try and push you to make purchases or watch a TON of ads."

US	1	2018-05-22	3.7.0	Zaphod Beebs	Poor customer service, glitchy rewards.	Typical 3 on 3 fighting game with building things (including wait times) and collecting and leveling up characters (dragons in this case). Amusing game but it offers nothing new. However, before you spend any money on the game, make sure you are familiar with Apple’s refund procedure. The rewards from events are glitchy and when you get frauded out of a reward and customer service only sends you form responses, you’ll want an avenue to get the money you spent back.
US	5	2018-05-22	3.7.0	What a freat game.	It’s great.	The reason why it’s great is because you get to have dragons, which are legendary creatures. I don’t really like fantasy stuff and games, but this is the best game on my iPad yet.
US	5	2018-05-21	3.7.0	amcelya	Great game	This is the best game on my I-pad!
US	5	2018-05-20	3.7.0	adentheapple	Beautiful game	This is so cute game because baby dragons fighting just beautiful pls make a new one of this pls😘😱👍🤜🏻🙏🏻
US	5	2018-05-20	3.7.0	Saiorius	Favorite game ever!!!	This is by far one of the best games I have ever played, not only is it fun but it also has so many different types of game play in it it’s not just about following the battle map there are events all the time, dungeons, friend points, arena, etc. and my favorite part is it is FTP friendly! I’ll admit I bought a small pack at the beginning to give me a boost but once you level up a bit and collect your gold throughout the day it’s easier to level up yourself and your dragons. My only problem is the dragons could use some beefing up IMO; on the loading screen the (fire) dragon looks amazing! The baby dragons are cute but after level 4 they look like teen dragons I was surprised this was their full grown form. It’s pretty cartoonish, while I enjoy the game that aspect leaves me feeling like my 12 yo niece would enjoy it more

It happens every single time and I don’t know how to fix the problem..please help me with my game.

"Whenever I play this game and try to see friends Near Me the app says I have to enable Location Services to view the leaderboard and they’re enabled. I don’t know if it’s a problem in the game or on my iPad, but I don’t like it and hope the next update fixes it.
Don’t get me wrong, the game is kid-friendly and I recommend it. I’ve just been having this problem that I really want to fix and can’t figure out how."
US	5	2018-05-15	3.7.0	funtime dragon	Dragon mania legends	It’s a great game for people like kids who believe in dragons to play
US	4	2018-05-14	3.7.0	guitarguysgirl	Possible Improvements	I love this game, but it becomes frustrating to level up dragons after certain levels. Maybe make it possible to level up in other ways rather than just feeding. Talking to my clan members, we also wish for ways to bypass hatching eggs we don't want; maybe having the option to sell or gift the eggs would allow for free near space. I hope you take these thoughts into consideration for future updates. Thanks for an otherwise awesome game :).

US	4	2018-05-11	3.7.0	GlowBow	One of my favorites😻	This game is so fun, the higher u go the more you can get in rewards and dragons, etc. The only conflict I have, would be to make it a lil easier to enchant the dragons, I have so many materials but I don’t have the ones I need to enchant my dragons past level 2 or 3. Please give out more enchanted freebies that you will need for leveling up even further
US	5	2018-05-11	3.7.0	Cute kitten13	Love it	I love this game so much!!! Add more types of dragons like poison, leather and MUCH a more dragons, how about for new dragons you give them a third move... these are just ideas I LOVE THIS GAME. I persuaded 5 of my friends to download

US	4	2018-05-06	3.7.0	Starbucks forever☕️	Fun but a few issues.	I really enjoy this game except it can be very slow, and adds pop up every 5 seconds! I cant play the game without accidentally tapping a add and it taking me to safari. It has constantly offered me to pay in money for gems,gold, dragons, food, etc. I just want to play the game without being transported to another app or having to pay. Other than that, this game is great and addicting!

US	5	2018-05-05	3.7.0	Delaware Shep	This game is fun	"I've played off and on for 3 years and it still holds my interest.  They have frequent challenges and special events that keep it interesting. Plus, it's fun to collect the different dragons.

It's kind of a farming, kind of battle game."
US	1	2018-05-05	3.7.0	r3m0nz	PLEASE FIX DML!!!!!	This latest update is awful, specifically an ad for Island Empire Falls, or something like that. I don't get a chance to write it down, but not only does it crash the game it crashes my entire system and a hard reboot is required. This has happened more than once. I got used to the Goldfish Photo Bomb ad crashing the game but this is so much worse! Ive been playing for 3 years but am afraid to try again until this has been fixed.

US	4	2018-05-04	3.7.0	I'm Ladybug	Need Berries!!	"This is a beautiful game with really cute dragons and lots to do.
One problem: The farms cannot produce enough berries needed to keep one busy. Very redundant to have to click a million times on farms to plant and harvest forever and a day, and still not enough berries!
Farms should produce twice as much per planting, and feeding should not double each time! Too tedious to get to the fighting and other things."

Please keep added new dragons an more fun features! Love it congrats makers of this game it’s fun an unique in its own special little way!

US	5	2018-05-03	3.6.1	Mom2KMA	I love DML!!! 👍❤️😁	"Hi there! I just wanted to say that I LOVE DML so much. There are adorable (but fierce) dragons that ere all equally unique, did I already say that they are super cute?? I especially love the boiling dragon. He looks so tough! If your a parent reading this, then I would recommend DML. There is no blood, and the only kind of violence is during dragon battles. All they do is hit each other with fire balls or other dragon stuff. When a dragon reaches zero health, all the do is kind of lay down and close there eyes, and then teleport off the battle field. Great idea. Second thing is that when you breed dragons, all you have to do is select two dragons, and then wait a certain time (varied by witch dragons) for them to make an egg! Then they go back to there habitats like nothing ever happened. Then the egg goes to the hatching place were after a time varied on witch dragon egg it is, all you do is swipe on the egg a few times to hatch your new baby dragon. To have your baby dragon grow up, you just need to feed them to level four. Four fruits per level. But watch out, you could run out of food! Luckily the DML has farms! You can grow your food there! Also, you battle evil Vikings, for they are trying to steal the dragon codex from you!! Fight them by battling epic dragons. One more thing, if your a girl, Arya will lead you through the beginning of DML. If you a boy Tim, Arya's brother, will lead you through the beginning of DML. But either boy or girl, you will certainly have fun playing DML anytime, anywhere. I don't get how people could give this game any less then four stars.

US	2	2018-05-02	3.7.0	Novaenergy2	Ads	I understand the need for ads in a F2P game, but they keep. On. Popping. Up. I’m almost ready to uninstall the game because of it. They’re just random and constant.
US	5	2018-05-02	3.7.0	OldMamaKole	So Cute & So Much Fun!!	I would totally
US	5	2018-05-02	3.7.0	✨EMR✨	Thanks for Updating	"I think this game is really fun and cool you can breed dragons and buy them you can also get habitats for the dragons battle and train them to make them the best they can be✨Get this game!
Suggestions: I want to be able to move the habitats even with dragons in them and move other things like the portal, temples, breeding cave, and the nursery. (If you are able to do that please tell me.) I know this sounds a little silly but I keep making mistakes about hatching dragons Ex. I will go into my storage and I will click hatch on accident then I have to  wait  a day for it to hatch when I have something in the breeding cave about to hatch in three hours so my suggestion is to put a button that says ""Are you sure you want to do that?"" (Then put two buttons that say ""Cancel"" then ""Yes"") this will make stuff a lot easier! 😊
About my character: I can't find out how to change my name (on the game) or edit my picture. Help!"
US	5	2018-05-02	3.7.0	7,2,2002	😊	I actually like this game it’s really good and cool if u like dragons and like taking care of things lol. It caught my eye and I haven’t been able to stop playin it since I started

US	4	2018-05-01	3.6.1	Up and Down 123	Dragon Mania Legends Ups and Downs	"Great game and I enjoy playing it but it has some problems because the names can only have 6 letters and also why cant you box your dragons? It would save space and money (fake money of course not real) and again about the letters a name like Stormy for your cloud dragon barely fits overall great game but I hope they add more letters and let us box
 dragons"
US	5	2018-04-30	3.6.1	Lpore7	Great game!	I love this game and it is so addicting but one suggestion I thought it would be cool if you can also level up your dragons by battling.

US	3	2018-04-29	3.6.1	Hannah S WWDB	If fixed 5 stars	Takes WAY to king to level dragons. And berries take too long to the point where your stuck until you have enough to proceed. About to delete the game almost no point.

I like the game the only problem with that game tiny bit many things you have to buy (Real money And game coins) but overall this game is the best 🐉🐉🐲"
US	5	2018-04-28	3.6.1	Thalia Quintero	💗 love	OK so I love love love love LOVE this game because you don’t have to wait forever and ever and ever and ever and ever because some games like this you have to wait like 24 hours which makes me so mad so so so so so so so so mad and it’s very very really uncommon and really for me to actually put a review on it because I actually don’t put a lot of reviews on a lot of stuff so I love the breeding LOL I love it so thank you for creating this game PS your love
US	5	2018-04-27	3.6.1	Nothing to buy	Fun game big problem	The game is awesome but their are wwwwaaaaayyyyy to many adds. Every 30 seconds their is an add
US	4	2018-04-27	3.6.1	anymonous2006	Incredible game but..	The game is a wonderful game where you can breed and battle and etc. but there are too much ads that’s always on your screen ...but other then that it is a good game. For a suggestion for the next update can the developers add battles with your friends because I want to battle my friends dragons and see who wins
US	3	2018-04-27	3.6.1	yerr2424	Too muc ads	"It always shows the same ad
Im tire of it"
US	3	2018-04-26	3.6.1	PhoenixFlame127	Review	The game overall is good, even if the dragon game subject is a little over used. It’s different from other dragon games and actually has backstory. It was sort of refreshing to see a dragon game that wasn’t straight up a DragonVale rip-off.
US	5	2018-04-25	3.6.1	SebasFlare	Nice and cool	The plot is good and it is so kawieii.

US	2	2018-04-24	3.6.1	Mikemo187	Download issues	Have to download data every time I log on to get access to all the content.  Takes 10 minutes every time.  Waste of my time.
US	4	2018-04-23	3.6.1	jman2595	Great game that needs to be on consoles	"I love this game but there are things about it that makes me mad and just doesn’t make since, the main thing is not being able to play it offline I don’t understand why it needs a internet connection other than to do in app purchases with real money but not everybody does that and we should have the options to play offline. Second thing is that the amount of time until you can have more habitats for your dragons I mean you put all these dragons there and by time you have the dragons needed to breed the dragon you want there’s no room for the dragons you been trying to breed and it takes way to long to get to the level that you get more habitats but that’s it for the game right now. I do think it would do very well on the Nintendo Switch and other consoles if you fixed the issues I listed above and changed the view that you see everything from I would love to see it on the Switch and I think if done right it would sell very well at both physical retailers and Eshops.

Please consider the things I talked about above and thank you for the game. -Jake"
US	5	2018-04-22	3.6.1	Catattack13	LOVE the game! Have a few suggestions	"First of all, I absolutely love this game. It is the best app on my entire phone and I never grow board of playing it. I have been playing for almost 3 years now, and I have seen the game evolve in so many new and interesting ways. definitely worth five stars ( I don’t say that a lot)

Second of all, I have a few (somewhat out there) suggestions. The first is that you should randomly assign dragons genders, this would not only be interesting, but would also make breeding more difficult for you could only breed dragons of opposite sexes. The second is that you should have a design a dragon contest, where you print outlines of the different body shapes for people to print and color in. They would also write the name of the dragon as well as choose the elements. Then they submit it to you with an entry fee (which a lot of people would be willing to do) and you choose a winner(s) who’s designs would be added to the game for people to get probably in the form of a leader board challenge. Thank you SO much for reading my review!

US	5	2018-04-22	3.6.1	Porfolio G.	Obsessed	I kept my Windows phone a lot longer than I wanted to specifically for this game. Alas, I moved into this decade and got an IOS... had to start all over but this is still an awesome game and even better on IOS. In-app purchases but not to the point of being annoying.

US	4	2018-04-20	3.6.1	Master Cee	Too many ads	Very good game with great art, but too many pop up ads
US	2	2018-04-20	3.6.1	Gubgee	Would not recommend	This game has ads galore and half of the game makes you buy stuff with real money! They are getting greedy and teaching kids to spend their money, or their parents if they're that desperate, and this is not good. Through it all though, the game is pretty fun. When you get through the walls of ads that if you accidentally click on, (they pop up really fast! ) then you are put on their website and it's SUPER annoying.
US	5	2018-04-20	3.6.1	DEadsII	Awesome	There’s no bugs this game is great there is one thing when it need to update it won’t let me play without me updating it which I don’t really like but other than that there’s nothing else that bad.
US	4	2018-04-20	3.6.1	CodyTheGamer	I Love It! One MAJOR issue	"•One issue! Every time I open up the app I have to download content. It's so annoying. Please fix it if you can. 
•I love this game so much! You have no idea! The dragons are so cute! Even if they lose I still love them, I just have to level them up. 
•Even though the dragon of the month is hard to breed, that's the point, it's why you have a WHOLE month to try and get it. 
•I like the enchanting dragons. It makes them so much stronger. I also like the defenders, I like fighting people. I like the potions too, it makes it easier. 
•I like the training idea, it makes them stronger for an hour! 
•I like how you have to have a certain amount of food. So I can calculate that and wait till I have enough food and level him/her up there. 
•Anyways! I cannot wait for the new updates to come! The game to me just gets better and better :3"

This includes the Earth Dragon thing, one of my own dragons, and some of the dragons that can be bought in the store. They just turn gray with a question mark. Wama, my Ceremony Dragon, has to be ""downloaded"" every time I get back in. It also wants over 100 more MB's of data, when I choose download all. It's quite frustrating. It's never happened before, yet suddenly I've got so many things to download! PLEASE FIX!"

US	4	2018-04-12	3.6.1	CuteCoolPopular101	Less food	So, DML is such a fun game. I play it at 6:30 in the morning, but when your dragons reach higher levels, it costs too much food. My dragons are at Level 11 and the food costs 1,280!! Thats way too much. You should change the food to go up at least 20 foods each level.. Food is way too much each level and I would like to higher level up mr dragons but I can't. I can't because I don't have enough food for each dragon. Please, please, please, update it so it would cost lest food :) Thanks
US	5	2018-04-12	3.6.1	🧞‍♂️🧞‍♂️🧞‍♂️	I rate it 4.9	The only problem is that this annoying goldfish ad pops up but otherwise 🐉 mania is awesome good job Gameloft
US	3	2018-04-12	3.6.1	Ninja The Pug	Too many ads!	I love the game, and I have been playing it for years. But the one thing I hate is the constant ads. Like, I get an ad less than fifty seconds or logging in. And then, whenever I try to tap a habitat/arena battle/champagne map/ anything else, it loads and ad and then it sends me to Safari to look at it and it takes way to long to get back in. I'm so frustrated!!!! The Packs are expensive and I don't like that in the Arena that they match you up with people way higher than you. Sometimes for the refresh, it just gives you more hard ppl to battle and I keep losing. Yes I know I have to feed and send my dragons to the academy to get stronger, but that doesn't work. I keep getting matched up against way stronger ppl! And yes, I know everything is not free and you need the money, but one pice of advice is to make the ads less consistent. Another thing that needs to be fixed is the ad videos for card packs and gift chests. Either the ads don't load, or the game crashes and then I have to wait another 12 hours to start this crap again. But other than that, it's a pretty good game
US	3	2018-04-12	3.6.1	Draclp	Can you stop or do something with the pop ups adds?	"I absolutely love this game with it’s art style and idea it’s feels more open world then most other dragon games even in my book beats dragon city!

Plus its cute!

However the constant popups and long adds coming doesn’t feel great as I have to wait before doing something or anything or stop and they never stop. If you can please stop or end those constant adds popping and stopping me from doing everything for a while?

Like a option or online get them if you want to earn money or something worth them as it happens so much now?"

I’m so frustrated mad the advertisements in this game is ridiculous. It’s lagging all the time. Thought it may be my phone service or my WiFi. Tried both turned off WiFi then turned it on played it elsewhere other than my house. Nope nope nope it will be getting deleted. I hate advertisements so much.
US	5	2018-04-08	3.6.1	Jordab Cole	I Need Gems!	The Only bad thing is that I need more gems, but they are so overpriced I can’t get any. And even if I did it is like 200 dollars for a good dragon!
US	3	2018-04-08	3.6.1	rdoll333	I don’t know how much longer I can play	This was once my favorite game, but I got a new phone and had to start over and it isn’t as fun for one main reason, the game loses connection constantly and I have rarely been able to finish a battle without it restarting and losing the energy for the battle with nothing to show for it. This limits me to only really being able to feed, pet and breed dragons which really is only a small part of the game. If this doesn’t change soon I’ll probably just stop playing. I’m glad I haven’t spent any money on this game yet and there is no way I will until I can truly play all parts of the game.
US	5	2018-04-06	3.6.1	Homer1026	Minor Changes	"First of all,  I'd like to say this is an amazing game.  Well done!  But I think there are a few things that could be changed and added to improve gameplay.  Such as the ability to sell element temples.  I recently bought a fire temple thinking that if I decided I didn't like it I could just sell it.  But I can't,  I have no use for it and now it's taking up space.  I also think that you should create egg storage.  So say that your dragons just finished breeding,  but you don't want to hatch that egg right away.  Well,  you could put it in storage and hatch the egg when you want.  Because I find it very annoying that I am forced to hatch the egg right away which can sometimes take eleven hours or more.  And here is another thing,  there are way too many ads.  In my opinion it's very annoying to see an ad pop up as soon as you exit somewhere.  Because what happens is I click the ad on accident and it takes me to the download page.
And my final idea is being able to gift or sell dragons you own to other players of the game.  I think this would be great because some people don't like some of the dragons they have,  but they don't want to sell them.  These are some changes and adds I'd like to see in the future."
US	5	2018-04-06	3.6.1	CharliPlayz59	Amazing but...	DML is such a amazing game I try to play it everyday and I love watching other people play it! My only problem is they have a lot of ads now it's not horrible amount of ads like Kick The Buddy. But it does have an unfair amount of ads. Also I don't like how the best way to enjoy the game is to buy things I understand that a free game has to make money some how! But it feels like people who bought stuff are having way more fun then people who did not. But overall I recommend this game to you! Cause there is so much to do breed dragons be rare buy islands. So bye!

I have been playing for three years, and I have never once gotten bored of it. ! I have barley spent any money on this game and I am having a lot of fun with it. My favorite part is the DOTM. I love trying to breed it, and using crazy combos. Please continue to make this game better and better

US	5	2018-04-05		Thought it's nice	Time and Money Well-Spent	This is my second time playing through Dragon Mania Legends, and I have no regrets! The game is light-hearted, fun, and keeps me engaged. The events nowadays are well-thought-out and quite fair, and the gameplay is superb. I have to admit that I’m not a huge fan of the graphics, though. Many of the dragon designs make me, as an artist and designer, recoil heavily. But that’s merely a sidenote amongst the clever overall execution of this game. Where other games focus on aesthetics, DML aims to provide a positive user experience- and delivers. I’ve spent quite a bit if money on this gane ever since I started playing it a couple years ago, and will continue as long as it remains exciting. I’d like to see sone graphical and conceptual improvements to the dragons themselves, but I can understand the limitations the developers may have. If you’re looking to download a fun sim game, this is the cream of the crop!
US	5	2018-04-04	3.6.1	Allyyyyy117080808	Best game EVER played	so addicting so fun just LOVE IT
US	1	2018-04-04	3.6.1	Jojo20851	Constant downloads	While the game is fun, having to download 205mb every time I log into the game before I can even access fights or clan items is not so much. I have done everything from uninstalling, to re-downloading and clearing the memory cache. Nothing works. I have also emailed for help, but have yet to receive a response. Maybe it’s a bug for IPad Air. Not sure, all I know is that it makes the game very frustrating to play. These black dragons with red question marks as well as black items with red question marks are really annoying...
US	3	2018-04-04	3.6.1	Kat32879	Fun, but...	I love playing this game, but the in-app purchases are necessary to get through the events....or you have to be on it 24/7 to accomplish events.
US	5	2018-04-04	3.6.0	TheNinjaEmoji	Best in the West	"I think it is almost impossible to beat such a good game if they would change that they had so many adds if I could I would rate it 10 stars!you can breed,hatch,battle and more!It is addicting so I play it often unlike a lot of games so it is a great game and would recommend it to everyone to play and have fun so I was glad to find out about it.    

        Suggestion:take out adds except for the ones you get things for and it would be 1,000%"
US	5	2018-04-03	3.6.1	BlueRaptorBird	Awesome!	"I’m aware many people are saying that you have to pay to play the game, but I haven’t spent a penny and I’ve made it very far. There’s many things to do here, it’s a great time killer. The graphics are very nice too. I really love this game XD Don’t let all the “pay to play” comments bring you down. If you work hard, you can get along jussssst fine.

US	5	2018-04-03	3.6.0	TanyaRC277	Join A Clan and the fun never ends	Love the game. Please enter  4e07ad   my friend code at the lighthouse when you get to Level 4. Awesome game, especially after you join a clan. You get help from everyone and advance quickly. My clan is in the top 15 of all the clans, and we usually place 1st or 2nd in the dragon races.
US	5	2018-04-02	3.6.0	Dominator 19467	Pretty good	The battle system is pretty innovative and the dragons are pleasing to the eye. I would definitely recommend this to fans of monster collecting games.

US	4	2018-04-01	3.6.0	Horse Lover 2.o	Good game, but...	This game is great, I do suggest getting it, but this review is not on that. I actually bred the sweet treat dragon after many attempts (a DOTW), which is a dragon that I like and want, and I wasn’t really paying attention when I was hatching it and I SOLD it! There is only 13 hours left for that dragon and I tried breeding it again and got 6 hours... I’m very sad. May I suggest adding a recycle bin where you can see dragons that you sold? I’m very clumsy so I know it could happen again, and it probably will.

US	5	2018-03-31	3.6.0	✨EMR✨	Please read!	"I think this game is really fun and cool you can breed dragons and buy them you can also get habitats for the dragons battle and train them to make them the best they can be✨Get this game!
Suggestions: I want to be able to move the habitats even with dragons in them and move other things like the portal, temples, breeding cave, and the nursery. (If you are able to do that please tell me.) I know this sounds a little silly but I keep making mistakes about hatching dragons Ex. I will go into my storage and I will click hatch on accident then I have to  wait  a day for it to hatch when I have something in the breeding cave about to hatch in three hours so my suggestion is to put a button that says ""Are you sure you want to do that?"" (Then put two buttons that say ""Cancel"" then ""Yes"") this will make stuff a lot easier! 😊

US	5	2018-03-27	3.6.0	cue-ball-3	A new element !!	DML is an amazing game, I love the designs of the dragons and even the new events. One thing I would like to see in dml is a different element. I know that we just got divine and all, that’s pretty cool not complaining. There should be a new element to get, maybe like a rainbow dragon, but it has the serpent body type but with a brand new element. I hope you take this new element into account, it sure would make the game a million times better than it already is.

US	4	2018-03-25	3.6.0	BathtubDoritos	Ad issues	Great game, but one major issue; the ads. I don't mind the amount, but I found some that crashed the game, were a bit graphic, or required a prompt that lead you to safari. I frequently need to close out the game just so the ads don't crash my phone. The ads should only be required as speed ups or as a way to get gold or food. The game is not very compatible with older devices, could that be fixed in an update?
US	2	2018-03-25	3.6.0	Mamajizzaboobalack	Fun game, too many ads	I loved the game but the ads are non-stop and having to constantly re-download content over and over. Sooo not worth.
US	4	2018-03-25	3.6.0	Socki =)	Good Game, But..	I have enjoyed playing this game for over a year now. I had to previously uninstall because it kept forcing me to download more content to play and I didn't have enough space but that problem seems to be fixed. The issue I have now is you cannot add friends in the game with iOS because game center has been taken away. So you either have to add a bunch of strangers on Facebook or go without the benefits of friends that the android players get. It seems the fix for this would be to skip the second party and be able to add friends directly in the game. Maybe where the visit button is on other users names there could be an invite button as well? I do really enjoy this game and play it daily and participate in events. It is pretty well balanced although some of the events are unrealistic to attain without spending real money there are plenty of other things to do for free. I would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the friend setback.
US	1	2018-03-25	3.6.0	Awepogo	Don't waste your time	"I don't get why people are rating this game so high when clearly the cons outweigh the pros
Sure it looks cute the contents is decent
But when you get an ad every other minute it's get obnoxious fast
Also the leveling curve is ridiculous 
The amount of gold and food needed goes up exponentially fast and the wait time for them is not rewarding enough
Overall a p2w game like others have said"
US	4	2018-03-24	3.6.0	Tbirdmomace	Love the game but it has problems	The cost of doing things in this game are way too much and I will not spend as you put it real money on a game.  The cost to clear the islands the same. I have played for quite some time and due to having to use the game money collected my highest rank dragon is 40. To move it up it will take over 800k to level it up.
US	3	2018-03-24	3.6.0	Tmammaz96	Ads	Love this game! The ads though.. I find the adds pop up more now then when I started playing it.
US	5	2018-03-24	3.6.0	ThunderJSM	Amazing game!	"This is the best campaign game ever. But, I want to tell you something.
Every time I hire my friend’s dragon and defeat Korloth, the game freezes in a loading sign. Then after I re-enter the game, it makes me do the battle all over again. I’ve been mad about this happening. Could you please fix this error?"

US	4	2018-03-22	3.6.0	Ayala The Lynx	Best Game! Few glitches.	It’s a really, it’s really fun and cooperative. There are a few glitches, as in my last game it failed and all my progress went away and there are quite a few ways to get that progress back but I was young at that time, so didn’t have that type of account or knowledge. There are still a few glitches here and there, every few often they do upgrade the game and it fixes some problems, sometimes causes a little more. Theses are just little glitches, don’t really bother much.
US	3	2018-03-22	3.6.0	avxman	Pay to play	Fun to play.  Sadly, to really enjoy the game, too many things need to be purchased, or videos need to be watched.

US	5	2018-03-21	3.5.0	Carito8910	It’s a good game but......	It is a really fun game and I’ve only had it since October and I’m already on level 63. It has a lot of fun features and furry friends to breed and grow. The only two things that are annoying are: that it asks you to keep on downloading more and more things at least twice a day and it has packs that cost real money and too much real money for what they are selling. Yes some of the packs are a good deal, but DML has a pack that costs $100! $100!!!! Anyway I still own the game and I haven’t purchased the $100 pack, so I’m good.

US	5	2018-03-21		OnVenus	My Favorite Game	I play DML every day. I got this in summer of 2017, and have been hooked since. There’s so much in this game! Where do I start?! When you first begin, the game takes you through all the basics. As you progress, the only place you’ll see a person talk again is on the campaign map. The animation in this game is absolutely stunning, and the dragons just keep coming! There’s almost always an event to participate in, whether it being clan, or normal. For the holidays, DML prepares the most genius ideas for a big event for Halloween or Christmas. There’s always a chance to get a new dragon! The clans are always fun, once you get to level 25. You can unlock new land, and there are so many elements! You can also battle in many places: Arena, campaign map, dungeon. New new new. New dragons, new event, new something. You can’t run out of things to do! I always recommend this game to people, it is so fun! Thank you for creating this game!

The last thing I want to say is, please bring the screen recorder back! I really liked that screen recorder!

I’m always trying to figure out how to catch with my friend, which makes me play it again and again. This game is great and if I were you I would immediately buy this app.

US	4	2018-03-06	3.5.0	Gracer091	Habitat Glitch?	"I have a dragon that needs certain  habitats- the habitats I have “Too many” of. I HAVE 3. So now I can’t hatch or breed any more dragons. :/

My other complaint is when you tap something, poof, awful pop up ad. It’s too much guys. 

My other complaint- why does it cost tons of gold to pick a 
F L O W E R. 

Otherwise it’s good gameplay- and cute dragons."
US	5	2018-03-04	3.5.0	DavidE113	Play it	Y’all are you going to install this game then you are the best😎🤩
US	2	2018-03-04	3.5.0	Zweety1199	Its 50-50	The gameplay is great and all and the dragons are quite challanging to    get but the only thing i hate is when i get the game (because i have it on my computer too) i have to start back to start and when i download loadable content nothing at all happens. So the tutoriel is still there and very freaking annoying. I was typing this on an iphone so dont judge me. And there is another problem, the game has alot of things you can buy and everything can be very expensive, as other people are saying it is unbalanced as if the game was asking for lots of food gold and gems, oh dont get me started on gems. Okay, here is the last problem about this game, DML legit forces you to spend your virtual currency like gems, it makes you spend like 10 gems already  in the beginning and wants people to have a habit of spending the gems for useless crap.

US	4	2018-03-02	3.5.0	Megy36	So close to perfect	"I love this game, but the biggest issue that I have is that ads pop up so much that it often makes it so that I accidentally leave the game. It drives me crazy. Sometimes the apps won't even close when I press the ""X"" button. 

 I know a lot of people say that it's pay to win, but I came in first in one of the big events and I didn't spend a penny, I just made sure to log on a lot and get stuff done."
US	5	2018-03-02	3.5.0	DragonHunter63	Some improvements to make.	I really love the game there is a good amount of detail used but with some of the events like the divine event with part 1 you only get like 6 days to complete it and there is 12 levels and some are really hard to complete because you don’t get that many floating lanterns so I think maybe give more days to complete but if you don’t it is ok so I hope you look this through.

US	3	2018-02-28	3.5.0	Rangerkale	Too many cigarette ads	It’s very fun, however there are just too many pop up ads about smoking, a reduction of the amount of ads or larger variety of ads would be better.
US	5	2018-02-28	3.5.0	Over five	Greatness at bay	This game is amazing. I love it, I play it very often.

This game is amazing, I definitely recommend it.

US	2	2018-02-25	3.5.0	EmeraldBaloney	Cut back on the ads	I like this game and it has some nice graphics but every 2minutes or so an ad would just pop up out of the blue and I can’t even close the ad so I would just have to stare at this creeped nicotine ad while waiting. Sometimes it would get so bad that I would have to exit and reload the app
US	5	2018-02-24	3.5.0	Puggy127	Awesome game!!!!!	This is a great game!!! I have been playing this game for 2 years now and I’m really happy y’all made a new type of dragon (AKA: Divine type)
US	4	2018-02-24	3.5.0	R-kA	Good game despite problems	I like the overall game. It is a fun way to relax and have fun. You get to build habitats for the dragons that you breed. There are lots of cool looking dragons to collect, wars to fight, and food to grow to feed your dragons. My biggest problem is the extra mini games that Gameloft gives you to play. Most of them are created in such a way that to participate you have to spend real money to buy gems to complete the mini-game. Since I don't like to spend money on digital toys it is hard to win the prizes and extra dragons. DML is also having problems with their advertising videos not playing or jamming up the game. Other than that it is pretty cool. All my siblings have an account on DML and they like it too.

I literally mean this whenever there is an ad I accidentally click it and it takes me to safari. Fix this plez! Other dragon games don’t do that! Seriously gameloft! Get real.

US	3	2018-02-22	3.5.0	MattSkeee	Wow ads	Fun game, but holy crap there’s so many ads. By the time i’ve finished harvesting my gold and food, i’ve already encountered at least 5 ads.
US	5	2018-02-22	3.5.0	Pokebored1	I am so disappointed	I love this game, and they are currently having an event where you can win “epic” dragons. Well, I worked really hard to get one, waited forever for it to hatch, and I was so excited because it was my first really cool dragon and I even saved all my food for this one dragon, then I hatch it and start feeding it and then the pop up saying I can’t feed it anymore unless I buy another temple comes up. I’m level 16, and the dragon has the shadow ability, so basically I can’t level up my coolest dragon until I’m level 45, and you have to be level 45 to get the shadow temple. I’m so disappointed and annoyed. There should be an exception for event dragons.

US	4	2018-02-21	3.5.0	JhonnyRaincloud	Excellent game -- too many ads	It's a very very good game. Very well made and fun. I've spent a lottttt of hours on it, and I've been playing for like 5-6 years. But recently I've stopped playing and just get on to collect money and breed because there are too many ads. Like I expect ads and I understand they're necessary to support the game. But wow. Like in the time it takes for me to collect all my gold three ads have popped up. And then I accidentally click on them because they take up the whole screen.
US	3	2018-02-21	3.5.0	RGloverii	VERY EASY FIX PLEASE READ	The ‘goldfish’ add that plays every time I log in crashes the game every time. REMOVE THIS ADD AND REPLACE IT! It’s very easy just replace it with something else, and get rid of the coding that came with it! Please, this is very frustrating.

US	4	2018-02-19	3.5.0	Guest1324	i love this game!!	i am really stuck on this game and haven’t been able to stop for a few days now. i love getting new dragons and how interacting it can be with the dragons instead of just leveling them up and gettin more. there’s a lot of games and activities you can do which is fun. my only difficulty is that i play this game along with my friend but he has a samsung while i have an iphone and it seems as if we can’t add eachother because of that. i wish theres an update very soon to fix this because it’s very aggravating. the game also just has a lot of adds nd you have to wait a very long time for things  hatch or level in the game which goes for any game though. great game and i love it💗 really want that update though it
US	4	2018-02-19	3.5.0	HeartBolt499	...	good game but the price of the lampions in the divine new year event in lvl8 is a little overpriced.. i don't care about the ads sometimes but the other stuff about the game is great! :D

It’s starting to get on my nerves that I can’t even enjoy this game anymore

US	5	2018-02-17	3.5.0	Avarenee3	Fun	Fun
US	5	2018-02-17	3.5.0	JudyJudithJudi	Fun but...	It's fun and engaging but most challenges what you have to use in way of gems, gold, food, etc. often far exceeds the rewards for your efforts. At times you end up at a loss which leaves you questioning if worth trying for challenges. In a sea of all of the users playing which I'm certain are well over let's assume 100,000 to only reward the top 10 or 15 users on most event challenges with event-only dragons I find a tad bit ridiculous. Recently unlocked new island for 150 million but most of the area is covered with obstacles that cost 21 million to clear each item. Very excessive IMO. Lots of users have found a way to cheat. While you can purchase gem bundles that basically lets you get more out of the game and faster, these players are not. They earn things in days that take months to earn yet their level is low it's obvious they aren't actually purchasing gems so you know they're cheating...
US	4	2018-02-17	3.5.0	Dsliffe	Four stars	This game is amazing but it limits the amount of dragons you can have, I think they should you have more dragons

US	1	2018-02-15	3.5.0	#1Welder	Money Grubbers	I downloaded this to play with my nephew. It was fun at first, the leveling was good and the dragons were fun to try and get all the different kinds. Then came the greedy hands. Look I realize this is a game that makes it revenue from in game purchases. I don't have a problem with that. My frustration come from the way the Design Team make it harder to play without paying money. My biggest example, when you get to a new level your energy gets renewed and you can keep battling. The frustrating part is they don't give you a choice to claim the credits. I don't know how many times I have logged in with full energy and my level goes up and the renewed energy is wasted. So a fight my allotted fights and then have to wait or pay more money to keep playing. The fighting is a joke. The leagues are just as much of a joke. You get to see one random dragon and decide if you want to fight, not knowing if that dragon is a representation of the others you will fight or if it's the weakest that will destroy all your dragons then you guessed it pay more money or leave the game. I play with my nephew and it's good time to talk and explain what tactics there are in the game , but to constantly have achievements taken away because I collected some food before I used up my fight credits is infuriating. I think I play this more just to stick it to them that I'm not paying a thing. You want to be fair and let me play with the rewards that playing provide I'll be happy to support the game, you want to intentionally make it a money grabbing middle finger to the player, I won't support or give any kind of review that helps get other wallets open up. I most of the clans are full of people who have quit. There are some die hard pay to play people on, but from the most part anyone who plays for a small period will see that all the incentives are only provided if you continually pay. Hence the VIP, if you give them $15 every 20 days you get extra tokens, faster hatching and more game play, and that timer just keeps ticking. So if you have so much money you can figure out how to spend it these guys will help, if you want to play a fun game that is customer centered, keep looking, all they want is your credit card numbers.

But today I watched like 6 videos to “earn” free stuff... but it wouldn’t ever let me actually “spin” the wheel for my free stuff...  very frustrating.
US	1	2018-02-12	3.4.0	Lukebear7	Pay to win	All gameloft is interested in is your money pretty much everything in this game will eventually cause you to spend money in order to get dragons or to progress. They give you very little for your hard earned cash! Be smart save the money you would spend on this idiotic game and get yourself a game console or take a vacation. These people are crooks who have found a way to legally steal. I will never download or play another gameloft game again. Avoid this company. Zero stars gameloft zero STARS

US	2	2018-02-10	3.4.0	Melisue1834	I’m tired of having to continually download the content.	I really enjoy the game, however all the time I’ll load it up and every dragon is greyed out, and none of the features work outside of collecting gold. When I attempt to do anything it wants me to download content; which I have already downloaded a hundred times. It’s not my WiFi as my sister and daughter play without this issue. It’s incredibly frustrating.

US	1	2018-02-07	3.4.0	Little Fireball	Beware of the Greedy Developers 🤑 and their Money Pit! 💰	"Dragon Mania Legends is a Pay2Win Freemium money pit run by the greediest, slimiest developers I have ever come across in the entire App Store. Greedloft, as I call them, constantly releases premium content only available to people who are obsessed and foolish enough to fork over tons of real cash in order to collect every Dragon. 

Around 75% of the Dragons in this game are not available to players who do not spend tons of real money to obtain them. These horrible ""Divine Dragon Event"" debacles are a prime example of how disgustingly greedy this company is. 
Players who dump ridiculous amounts of cash into the game are the ONLY ones who enjoy it to its fullest. They are the ones raving about it and giving it glowing reviews. But the habit of spending money on virtual currency to get virtual pets is truly gambling in disguise. It makes me sick to my stomach when I imagine how much real money fools actually spend on this game, buying their way to the top of the leaderboards, enchantment league, and getting every single dragon (you know who you are). . . There are people STARVING in this world, and here you fools are, throwing hundreds and thousands of dollars/pounds/euros/etc of real money away on stinking VIRTUAL PETS! You should be ashamed of yourselves. Have you no conscience or soul??? 

Not only that, but the game requires an Internet connection -- the game and its servers won't be around forever, and eventually you WILL lose all of your content (yep, and your money!). I refuse to give Greedloft a red cent! Of course, if you don't shove money down their avaricious throats, you WILL be punished -- you will have a slim to none chance of obtaining the special dragons, and you will end up hating this game. Nothing but an anxiety-inducing chore. Gameloft are a bunch of sadistic pigs!

Don't gamble for virtual pets, people. It is wrong, and you will be kicking yourself in the future once you've realized how much money you've wasted on pixels that can only be accessed through the Internet. Also, this game encourages children to gamble. 
Don't give Greedloft your money for Gems for their overpriced, overhyped premium Dragons and VIP status. If Greedloft is not going to be reasonable and make the game fair and at least somewhat enjoyable for those who want to play for free, they don't deserve anyone's money! 👎"

US	5	2018-02-04	3.4.0	Tesla Fnaf lover	THIS GAME IS GOOD AS HELL	This game is so cool I neamed some of my dragons FNAF and I'm makeing my world like Freddy faz Bears pizza dragon and my team mates if I go to battle thay will be this chica will be level 25 Bonnie level 25 and Freddy level 30 and keep leveling them up and every sat I update my dragons habbites and that's all
US	5	2018-02-04	3.4.0	magic5D	Very Addicting	I deleted this app once because I thought it was getting boring but I just decided to download it again and all my dragons were restored! Dragon ML is VERY addicting and the quests and limited edition dragons give you something to do (I'm currently going for the Root Dragon) The only thing that's annoying is that you can only have 1 habitat before you have to reach another level, basically making you upgrade it.
US	2	2018-02-04	3.4.0	Coco7809	Madison	I love this game because I love dragons
US	5	2018-02-03	3.4.0	lil ant28	The best	Coolest game
US	4	2018-02-03	3.4.0	everyday honest 21	Ok, I Will Play It...	It’s not addicting. If its glitchy for you it must be your WiFi. This game is slick- the most unglitchy game I have. The fighting is pathetically stupid-but I just play it for some strange reason. This game has never let me down- although sometimes, like in the article “Are you kidding me?!l” I have to download data, if I don’t my dragons look like paper, they are gray and have a question mark on it. Game Makers, BTW two people or more gave A -3 star rating- and this game is rated 4.7 stars.... strange, right? I have to say something good about this game- of course. The dragons are utterly majestic, though its to hard to get the dragon of the month. Game devs. Please put this out here for people to see, for they NEED to know this! I rated it 4 stars for one reason,  when I looked at 4.7 stars, I was like, maybe people with think I am stupid if I rated it under 3 stars. So here I am- lying about the amount of stars it should be given. Oh, btw, its kind of creepy when I get a message saying “Thank you for your feedback, please contact the game developer to give you tips on beating levels!” Umm, no thanks! When I get a game and write a review, the game dev. Always Email me saying what is in quotes. If I need tips to beat levels, the game is probably to hard for me, I don’t know about anyone else but I prefer to do stuff independently. Thanks for reading to the end- you don’t have to Email me, it’s creepy...📝
US	5	2018-01-31	3.4.0	Hyper Somic	Awesome	This,gives me pure joy
US	5	2018-01-31	3.4.0	Eralayse	Great game but adds	Awesome game!! Way too many adds constantly popping up!!
US	5	2018-01-31	3.4.0	thegamesucks.	Various dragons	There are many kinds of dragons and I love it very much and I recommend it
US	5	2018-01-30	3.4.0	lunarspacewolfdragon🐺🐉	Awesome! A tiny problem....	I love it! There is a small problem though... the waits are sooooooooo long! Otherwise it's great!
US	5	2018-01-30	3.4.0	Lavaspiritwolf	Best game I have ever played ❤️〰❤️	The game is wonderful, though I wonder if the game could give you a warning when an ad pops up. I want the warning because I tend to tap my screen when it gets dark because my phone is annoying like that so when that happens I tap the ad sending me here. Also when you tap on a dragon that has a special animation (ex: banana dragon) sometimes my game lags but I can't tell if it's my phone or the game, but I'm writing this just incase its not my phone (which I think it is my phone) welp thx for reading my review and remember read reviews before getting ANY game, this is a wonderful game an you should play it, please and thank you.
US	1	2018-01-29	3.4.0	Nosewhistle	Are you kidding me?!😂😂😂	This app is so bad, it's funny.  A got it in October of 2017, I had a awful experience. The app kept crashing, in fact less than a minute after I downloaded the game (which took 30 minutes) the thing crashed and I couldn't even open the game for days. Believe it or not, there's still more to complain about. My brother used to play it to, and he had a worse experience than I did. At one point he didn't sign on for two days, and when he did two of his dragons wasn't there. As of right  now he has had 5 dragons that have been deleted. The whole game itself is just awful. The whole game is is really glitchy. And there Aren't words to describe my frustration with the frequency of adds. I mean, I'm embarrassed that I wasted my time with this game. I think the amount of adds is scary. I deleted the app 3 weeks after I downloaded it. This whole game is a joke. I've told other people how bad it is. Things need to change. If I could do it again, I would never download the game in the first place. Your game is a stupid ripoff if dragon city, and DragonVale. You just added fighting to the equation, which made it 100,000,000 times worse.
US	4	2018-01-29	3.4.0	jman2595	Only 1 or 2 problems	It's a great game I love it except for the fact that it requires a internet connection! My internet is not that good and that's probably going to mean I won't be able to play that much. I would like it if the developer of the game would make it playable offline and some dragons are almost impossible to get unless you use real money which I don't have much of. Also I think this game could be bigger and better on the Nintendo Switch I think the developer of the game should seriously consider that.
US	5	2018-01-29	3.4.0	Galatealb	Cool	Good game
US	5	2018-01-28	3.4.0	hyenatwin23	Absolutely an amazing game	You should definitely get this game ideal for any mobile phones or gadgets it’s a must have game 1st recommendation I would give you
US	5	2018-01-27	3.4.0	MarKat79195	THIS GAME IS AMAZING	This game has brought so much joy to me! I had been so bored so I looked up dragon games on the App Store and saw this. I thought it would be like most dragon game you feed them and battle. But the moment I was on I was amazed by the graphics and just everything! I hope that many more will get this game to experience the joy it brings! Thank You!
US	5	2018-01-27	3.4.0	Lexi0321	Don't waste your time	I got the app a while ago and at first it was very addicting but it kept crashing. Time has flown by and i decided to get the app again . I'm having the same issue. It will not let me exit out of anything . My screen just freezes up on the process where they want to show me around

US	1	2018-01-24	3.4.0	Famous_Dave23	EXCESSIVE ads ruin the gameplay	I understand, actually don't even mind the, watching ad videos for in game bonuses. Its creative in a way. My issue is the overly consistent forceful ads during the game play. Going to feed your dragon-BUY THIS NOW! (must wait 5sec to close ad video out-only 5sec but usually right as your about to click something in the gameplay and then it opens your browser and takes you to some questionable website).
US	5	2018-01-22	3.4.0	Memesells	FUN!	Great way to pass idle time
US	5	2018-01-22	3.4.0	Jbelle344	4 stars	I would give this game a 5 star review, however, I am constantly having to download content multiple times a day and it becomes discouraging to play. The events are fun, the game play is entertaining, and the clans really bring it together. I recommend it if you can handle the content issues.
US	3	2018-01-21	3.4.0	Tambean7321	Downloading	Don’t like downloading 2 and 3 times a day.
US	4	2018-01-21	3.4.0	GeekyZebra	Amazing!	I just started playing and I love it! There’s so many things you can do and I just love the dragons, the only problem I have with this game is the ads. There’s too many so if you could take it down a notch, I would give it 5 stars
US	5	2018-01-21	3.4.0	...(-_-)...	DragonML  rocks	Im LOVING DragonML so far!My eyes there burning.I have only played for 10 minuets and I can’t stand how good it is.Im dead
US	4	2018-01-20	3.4.0	Vendetta&90	Great game	Me and my daughter play it together we enjoy it very much and it brings smiles to our faces to play together but when you start unlocking islands it’s hella expensive and u pretty much just have to wait forever
US	5	2018-01-19	3.4.0	DominicHK13	SO ADDICTING	This game probably HAS to be the best game ever. Usually I can’t stand waiting games but this one specifically is great.

US	2	2018-01-18	3.4.0	#Unicornlove	Very fun but one problem	I am not exactly sure what it is but I have a dragon in my hatchery and a habitat for it with another dragon in it. And something isn’t letting me place it in a habitat.
US	5	2018-01-18	3.4.0	hlkbccheer	Really fun!	This game is really fun, and mildly addicting, my kids and I love to play. I actually like that you can’t do everything that you want to immediately; the game forces you to wait for certain things (unless you are willing to spend real money, then you can speed things up a bit, e.g. buying gems to grow food). This allows us to put down our iPads and do other things while waiting. Really super fun!
US	4	2018-01-18	3.4.0	Cricket69j	Love it!	This game is one of the best dragon games of 2018! I love that there is such a variety of dragon elements, and types, such as a snake, or a drake (haha I rhymed). I also love that there are new dragons, well to me anyway, every week! Another reason I love this game so much is how much fun I have in the arena. The arena is one of the best aspects, but I hope you (the developers) give us more battle arena energy. I hope you guys add in new types too like an undead element, or something, but one thing I hate about this game is that I need to re-download data that I already should’ve downloaded!! Well these are all the reasons I liked the game and one reason I don’t like the game. 🐉🐲
US	5	2018-01-18	3.4.0	h26281618	I love this game	This is the BEST dragon game EVER
US	5	2018-01-17	3.4.0	Computer place	Most Addicting Game Ever.	I have played this game more in the last month then any game on my iPad in the last 3 years. Great for all ages, even my grandbabies. I would give it 5 stars if they would fix the bug that closes and reopens the game for either network error or account signed in on another device, because it usually happens during battle and then you lose your energy or gems.
US	5	2018-01-17	3.4.0	Jessie81810	OBSESSED!!!	I’m absolutely addicted to this game!! I’ve always said I’d never spend money to buy a membership to a game or anything but I have spent money on buying dragons and buying VIP days, not that you have to. There are plenty of opportunities to earn diamonds and trial days for VIP, I just get impatient and I love this game so I bought packages. This game is so good I even got my sister to start playing with me and now we compete to see who can get dragons first and what not. My only complaint it that I have an iPhone and she has an android and we CANNOT find each other to add each other as friends or join a dragon team with each other and considering that’s one of the biggest reasons she started playing its a pretty big let down... if y’all could fix that I would literally have no complaints! I tell everyone about my dragons and send the new vr pictures you can take to all my friends, I’m 24 years old and obviously some nerds never grow up... we just get bigger and find cooler toys... lol
US	5	2018-01-17	3.4.0	ookamiwhitewolf	Getting worse	I was disappointed when the naming system came out and only six characters were allowed.  How am I supposed to manage 50+ dragons without naming them by their species?  Now u can’t play five minutes without an advertisement.  Bogus -_-
US	5	2018-01-17	3.4.0	York Brown	My opinion	Just can't stop playing it and I love it.
US	5	2018-01-16	3.3.0	galicia41	AMAZING	I’m in love with this game! I love seeing how these little creatures grow, and how they eat. This is better than a lot of other dragon games! I love art, I’m just suggesting that you should add a art dragon. 😁

US	5	2018-01-11	3.3.0	evie_ruiz	YES!	I absolutely love it. It is one of my favorite dragon games that I have ever played, the graphics are amazing!
US	5	2018-01-11	3.3.0	Jami5405	Good game	There is a problem that is really annoying me, and that problem is is that I have to keep downloading the same things over and Over and OVER again just to collect coins or or participate in events. When I load the game it comes up with some of the dragons and even some habitats dark gray with a question mark. And you have to download a bunch of stuff. So if you could please look into that that would be great. It is preventing me from playing my game. But over all it is still a good game

Just so you know you have the right book the first book in the series it has like this squared faced dragon on it. It dose not look that realistic also. Hope you read it it’s a great book by the way I like this game a lot:)

Well II’ve been trying to complete this latest challenge but for some reason the game keeps freezing only in the battle scenes. I’ve been trying to beat the dungeon and when it’s the computers turn the games freezes then restarts. When it did this the last time I used the gems to get to the next level which cost me forty-five total. Now I’m going to have to use gems again. Please fix this.

US	2	2017-12-30	3.3.0	Kat32879	Fun, but...	I love playing this game, but the in-app purchases are necessary to get through the events....or you have to be on it 24/7 to accomplish events. Disappointed to say the least.

I like the fact they now give you a gem after viewing the in app ads however the ads are so frequent they are getting annoying.  You have a few minutes to stop in and play and a 30second ad pops up.  Be ready to wait!"

US	3	2017-12-25	3.3.0	positiveminds	Good for a week or two	The animation is cute, and the battle style is fun, but I found that after playing for a few weeks you get increasingly blocked trying to do anything in the game. It doesn’t help that every few minutes an ad pops up no matter what you’re doing.
US	4	2017-12-25	3.3.0	dragon mania fan	Dear dragon mania,	I love the app! It's super fun to play! I just got it today and I already love it! I do have some complaints. One of my complaints is the constant adds. They pop up out of no where. It's sort of annoying to be honest. I'm glad you give us free jems to make up for it but it would be better with out adds. Another complaint is the price of things. Almost every thing is priced a little to high. It's hard for us new comers to compleat missions or things like that when it comes to the price. Also what if you can buy in app purchases? Then what? It takes way to long to save up. I hope you consider my ideas that is to this wonderful app please think about the ideas.
US	5	2017-12-25	3.3.0	Diamond_Hydra	Best dragon game	I’ve had three account on this and it’s the best, I’m sad because I lost two , I had a bunny dragon on one and a cupcake dragon on the other :(

US	3	2017-12-24	3.3.0	Eree16	Could improve	This game is so creative with it's different dragons, battles, land, and powers. I like it so much but the one thing I don’t like is that an ad plays every 2 minutes. I find myself dreading to play the game because these annoying ads keep interrupting me.
US	4	2017-12-23	3.3.0	DogeMemeKing	Great game but, one complaint	I have been playing this game for a couple of days and I already love it. You can breed your dragons, fight with them, and much more! But, I have one complaint. So, every time I play the game a ad.. always pops up from every 3-4 minutes here and their, if you were to click on a button or a habitat. I think the ads should come every 10-12 minutes. So it wouldn’t be so frequently and annoying. Though, at least when you put a bunch of ads on us you give us a reward sometimes. Though I would rather like it to be.. less frequent. Overall the game is fun and, definitely kid friendly. I’m looking forward to seeing new updates! :)
US	5	2017-12-22	3.3.0	briokiehhjbf	Super fun but.....	There is adds that pop up every other minute that's really annoying
US	5	2017-12-22	3.3.0	AMZYLO	Amazing	This game so fun! I’m addicted to this game. Accept some of the prices on the dragon packs are a lot. I rate 5 stars because it’s fun.
US	5	2017-12-21	3.3.0	Lunar disco	I'm tired of the ads	Ok ads here ads there they are everywhere witch is so annoying I hate the ads but I love the game so much I just wish there wasn't so many ads 😞
US	3	2017-12-21	3.3.0	TurtleeDove	A fun game with a big problem	"DML is a very fun and interesting game in concept, it has a lot of content to keep an average player like myself interested. I’ve had this game for a very long time and I’ve just recently re-downloaded it. While it’s just as fun as I remembered, there’s a big underlying problem with it that I’ve noticed since getting back into it.

This game is almost entirely pay-to-win. While I’ve gotten pretty far into DML without making a ton of in-app purchases (I’ve maybe purchased ~$5 worth of in-game items in the time that I’ve had it, mind you I’ve had this game since it’s early ages), it is absolutely clear that a good portion of the game’s enjoyment requires real-money purchases. From excruciatingly long wait times for dragon eggs to hatch, portal energy to come back, food to be harvested, etc... this game relies greatly on using and buying premium currency/perks in order to enjoy its content for more than 15 minutes every 2 or so hours. I honestly think this game would be a LOT better if wait times for certain things (especially for food harvesting) were lowered and adjusted. It takes a lot of patience to get far in this game, and that causes players to loose interest quickly.

Yes, DML is a definite great game. However it could be a lot better if the reliance on in-game purchases and premium perks (VIP tickets and gems) was lowered."

US	3	2017-12-20	3.3.0	Chrstian Logan	Too many ads	Every 2 minutes this add keeps coming up it won't let me exit it it's really annoying
US	1	2017-12-19	3.3.0	Atag6789	Too many ads	This game would be enjoyable except for all the ads. It doesn’t even appear to be an option to pay real money to remove them. And I don’t mean ads scrolling at the bottom, by ads I mean pop up videos or pop up advertisement games in which you have trouble closing and pop up while your breeding, collecting gold or during the arena. They pop up several times within the first 5 minutes of game play, so much to the point where it isn’t even worth playing. With so many dragon breeding games on the market choose another and you’ll be much happier.
US	2	2017-12-19	3.3.0	NodieR	It was good....	Ok so I used to love the game, but whenever I want to play the game it has the dragons in a question mark and when I tap on them it says I have to download it and it takes forever I HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY DANG TIME!!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬

NO bad feelings towards this game!"

US	4	2017-12-17	3.3.0	milecker	DragonML	This is a fun game, but when I was breeding 2 dragons that consisted of one of my battling dragons I couldn't battle with all 3 dragons, I could only hire a dragon once unless I waited a day or payed with gems

US	5	2017-12-16	3.3.0	Jonesxlr	More than Expected	I expected a cheap little dragon breeding game. I got a dragon breeding game with a story, battle mode, and being able to pet my dragons owo
US	2	2017-12-16	3.3.0	3LakesDave	Very unbalanced play...	While this game has a ton of content, the game suffers from a huge imbalance in the time it takes to produce food, the resource required to level dragons. You very quickly (around level 12) get to the point where food required to level a single dragon requires days of food. No dragon leveling, no resource gathering from special areas or dragon quests. The game basically shuts you down. Another challenge is the ‘busy’ interface required to support the content. You can barely see the game for all the interface buttons. Sorry Gameloft - too much content AND to little resource generation (food). The game becomes unplayable.
US	5	2017-12-16	3.3.0	BellTheJoksterWolf	I L💜VE THIS GAME	Everything about this game is great! I love finding out what new dragon I’ll get!
US	5	2017-12-14	3.3.0	Cow09	Awesome game! 👍	I LOVE IT
US	5	2017-12-14	3.3.0	jung wookseok	Help?	I’m really love this game but every 6-8 hours, when I open the app, or something I’m always having to download content! It’s gotten quite annoying. I don’t know if anyone else has this problem, but if you know what’s going on, please help! I don’t mind if the download content thing happens like every 3-4 days, but happening every 6-8 hours I open the app, it’s always having to download content. And again, if you know what’s going on, please help!
US	2	2017-12-14	3.3.0	electriclioplurodon	Good game but too many adds	This game is great don’t get me wrong but half the time while your playing it shows u adds. And it’s not like every five minutes it’s like every forty five seconds. Please stop showing so many adds.
US	5	2017-12-14	3.3.0	meow 84	This game is awesome 5 stars A+ but 1 thing.	My sister wants it to where we can have slots for different games. Please add this and bye.
US	4	2017-12-13	3.3.0	DaniellaPhoenix	Great Game!	This game is adorable, user friendly and fun. It has exactly the right elements in it to keep you interested and for those people who like to collect things, it’s got a huge variety of dragons that are both creative and unique. The only downside is that things are EXTREMELY expensive. I’ve wanted to buy things with gems before but when I saw how many gems extra things costed, that right there was enough to make me decide against it. Then on top of that how much gems cost to buy? Absolutely ridiculous. Why would I spend 50$ on gems to buy 3000 gems for a single dragon? Maybe 5$. Maybe 300 gems. It’s a virtual game. I’m not dropping 50$. So all in all I gave this game a 4 out of 5 stars because it’s a super fun, unique, adorable game but it’s way too expensive.

US	5	2017-12-12	3.3.0	animal jam is best	Fun but frustrating	I love the game but there is one teeny problem it's frustrating I always need to download data, I have bad dragons only two good ones and guess what I don't have space for their habitats!!! Grrr! So yea you might not want this game if you would not like that.
US	5	2017-12-11	3.3.0	AquaFlameTheDragon	Really cool!	I'm a female but I realllyyy love dragons! This app is perfect! Really cool! Tho I think taking off most ads is a good idea... I keep getting pop ups of ads... Really good game tho! Five stars!

US	3	2017-12-08	3.3.0	getiing fed up	Fun game but the ads are terrible	Instead of charging money to upgrade/boost the dragons, charge money for the app without ads. I would gladly pay money to not have to sit through 30 sec. videos. The gem gift at the end doesn’t do it for me.
US	4	2017-12-08	3.3.0	Jigger17	No more ads!!!!!!!	I'm sick and tired with so ads in this game! I love this game but please no more ads.

Ever since they switched to the Christmas theme this year all my dragons are black with question marks and it says I need to down load content. I have had to do this every day I login since this last update.

Very annoying. Luckily I’m so invested in the game I won’t stop playing it..."
US	5	2017-12-07	3.3.0	corgi lover 123	How great dragon mania legends is.	I think DragonManiaLegends is really a great game. I love it so much I play on it about two hours every day. I think we should have a different variety of Adds though.
US	2	2017-12-06	3.3.0	Obah42	Too many pop- up adds	Love the game but it gets really annoying with all the pop-up adds. I don’t mind watching videos to gain access to rewards, but the constant pop-up ads ruin a  quality game.

US	1	2017-12-05	3.3.0	The-Storyteller-Jess	Frustration	I love this game so much but thanks to the new update, I can't play the game at all. I have an older phone that does not have iOS.8 and usually I just play an older version of the game. But this time, the update is mandatory. The game begins to load then it tells me to update, which I can't do. I wish they made it so I could play an older version of the game, even if that means I'm missing out on some things. Cause I miss the game more then anything.
US	3	2017-12-05	3.3.0	SaphiraBluE44	Can't Update:(	I've been playing this game since early this year and have really enjoyed it! Updates in the past have been fine, however this time it won't let me update. I go into the app, it loads a bit and then tells me i can't continue playing unless I update it. I press the 'OK' button and it brings me to the app store. But there is no update button. I can't update this app and it's really frustrating. I miss playing. I've even tried deleting the app and re-downloading it, but that didn't work. DRAGON MANIA LEGENDS PLEASE HELP!!

US	5	2017-12-04	3.3.0	Lindsay*6181!	Excellent game to exercise your memory	DML is really 6 games in one which you play simultaneously.  There is conquering the campaign map, the clan events, the Arena Battles, Enchantment League, the dungeon, and dragon breading.  Oh yes, there are also special events which you can participle in such as the castle and calendar events, along with others.    Participating in these events helps to win powers and tokens which makes your dragons stronger and allows you to better compete in the other concurrent events.   Timing and the use of math is important to optimize your game play.   Often there is more than one path to accomplish a goal but some math skills are required to figure out which ones will cost the least jewels and game coins.   And you can always just breed your dragons, some of which are cute and others scary.    There are far too many dragons to get them all and DML makes new ones all the time.  Some of the best cost a lot of $$$.  But the vast majority are free.   Remember if someone buys a top dragon which is just a little bit stronger, this is what funds the game for everyone else.   For me, it is a great exercise in memory to remember the sequence of play needed between the concurrent games to allow for maximum rewards while spending minimal resources.  It is also a great activity to do with your grand children.
US	3	2017-12-03	3.3.0	Littleleisl	Love the interactiveness and personalities of the dragons but too expensive on every level	"I hate the fact that everything is so expensive it's designed for multi millionaires not for a person on fixed income.

  I also think finding and obtaining friends should be easy - not impossible! 
  At level 30 it says you can create your own clan cause I've applied to over 40 clans no reply and then I question how I would know but there are no instructions as to how to start your own and I don't know what level fighter I am. Have made several high price purchases all I got was a one day VIP ticket.
 I agree wholeheartedly with the person that reviewed and stated its turned in to cost vs play. They do mismatch you in fights make it financially impossible for some one to move forward. 50 million for an island then how equal money for clearing the island.
Anyone playing if you read this and know how to get friends please add me and tell your friends to add me and i have a clan egg forever with no clan Littleleisl iOS  my FB is leisl brown"

Hey, and I have an idea for you guys! If the creator of this game sees this, I just wanted to say that I really want the reindeer dragon but I have 0 gems, and I think you should give everyone enough gems on Christmas to buy the reindeer dragon. Well, have a great day!! 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
US	3	2017-12-01	3.3.0	Loves8kids	Love it, but...	If it weren’t for the intrusive ads, I would give DML 5 stars.
US	3	2017-12-01	3.3.0	Bored in WA.	Its a cute game	A little confusing with little clarification of differences between type of dragons used for   Missions. Example hybrid dragons( whats considered a hybrid dragon?) and instructions on  how to control types of attacks. Week to strong what determines it? Because is not the meter!

US	1	2017-11-27	3.2.2	AlphaSnaill	AVOID	This game has the most insanely greedy, sinister and egregiously overbearing forced ads I've ever seen in any free app I've ever played. Because this game has SO many forced pop up ads I'm going to avoid any and all Gameloft games! I hope anyone who reads does the same thing.

US	4	2017-11-20	3.2.2	Shizue3	Addicted	I like this game, enough variety to not get bored. I wish there was a way to earn a way to make collecting gold by petting your dragon go faster. I wish there was a gift all button
US	3	2017-11-20	3.2.2	radmusic1290	Too many ads	I love the graphics and the game play, but the ads are completely out of control. Every two minutes a twenty second commercial pops up that you can't skip, but will take you out of the game if you accidental tap it. After playing for over a year, I have finally had it; goodbye, my beautiful dragons. I love you, but the greedy developers have ruined the game for me.
US	1	2017-11-20	3.2.2	Shelly777xo	Ads every couple mins!	Literally. This pisses me off. I just downloaded the game and I can't stand it. Then they redirect you on safari to the add when you try to click to get away from it! The game seems great when I actually get to play around the ads. Is there a way to buy the game without it or will I have to just stop playing? I don't have the patience for this.
US	3	2017-11-20	3.2.2	Vegnus	Great but infuriating	"So far I am loving the game, but the constant interruptions to gameplay for ads is infuriating. That may be the sole factor that keeps me from sticking around long term.  It’s completely unacceptable.  Voluntarily watching ads for stuff like the bonus spins is one thing, but when they are forced on you every few minutes, that’s just bad design.

Money making could use some balance.  It seems like I have the opportunity to keep advancing, but the cost to do so rises faster than my ability to make money."
US	1	2017-11-19	3.2.2	KayMillss	Ads are getting too much	The ads have gotten ridiculous. You used to be able to exit out of them quickly but now they are all video. Which some have trouble even working, which ruins the game. I’ve had just black screens. They pop up soooo much more frequently now too. I get frustrated and just exit out and call it a day. I agree too that it has gone a little to towards trying to force you to pay to win. There is no way to succeed in the challenges without paying. I play every day, multiple times a day and I am always in almost last place.  The prices to buy things aren’t even realistic either. $99 for some gems?!? No thanks.  Yea there is $10 options, but you get basically nothing.
US	5	2017-11-19	3.2.2	Kdought	Love this game!	My girls and I love this game, and have been playing it for several years now.  We love hatching new dragons and feeding them.  Battling.  Challenges, clans, and all of it!  Such fun family times.

US	5	2017-11-18	3.2.2	Good, except	Is there an ad free version?	I really enjoy playing this game. It is great to team up with my kids in the clan. But it is very annoying to see an add or video every 2-3 minutes. Even when I watch an ad to get a free spin, this timeline is the same. I have begun to play less because of the wasted time and data. I would be willing to pay for an ad free version.

US	3	2017-11-18	3.2.2	Capt. Logic	Good, but....	This game is fun to play but there are way to many ads. I get an ad every 5 minutes and that is way to much and it's irritating. Other wise it is better than other games I've played that have gems. They make the gems easier to get and you can actually participate in events without feeling like it's not worth trying. Please make the ads less frequent.

US	5	2017-11-13	3.2.2	Indigo magenta	Great! And I have suggestions.	"Okay so I'm super pleased with results. It's an amazing and captivating app that keeps me coming back. So here are some things I think would make this app better. 

1. Longer name allowance 
I'm tired of spending time thinking of good 6 character names, I was hoping for 10+ characters 

2. Dragon accessories! Like collars, saddles, bridles, and more. Each can be either bought with coins (only especially rare ones cost gems) or found. And each has an ability, (a.e. Some accessories increase gold production, higher chance of gem drop, damage resistance or impact, etc...)

3. Archaeology! You could add a cave or chasm to find relic scraps, to find sweet armor for your dragons! 

4.  Avatars! Choosing an avatar to make a more individual character and experience. As well as seeing your own profile. 

5. Clans! Where you can join/create a team And help out/chat with one another. 

That's all I can think of right now, and I really hope you see this, but thank you, and I love the app."

I have to change my give you all the time because everything is confusing and when I am breed a new dragon gets the hatchery and the times done so I can swipe the edge all that stuff as soon as I go to buy new habitat says that they're all full and I can't get anymore and then you're right the review it all changes but then after that I can only buy one more and then I have to write a review.

US	5	2017-11-11	3.2.2	Raysgaming	Amazing!	This game is so much fun the graphics are so good and the dragons are adorable! The only problem I have had is the stupid mystery marks on the habitats and dragons. Other wise this game is great. Keep it up game loft
US	5	2017-11-11	3.2.1	Tmg1117	I love DragonML	I love the graphics and I like how you can breed legendary dragons but I don't like how you have to keep downloading data to see stuff and fight but overall IT'S AWESOME!!!!
US	5	2017-11-10	3.2.2	Asmin234	I WANTED [VIP] FOR AGES!!!!!!	Thanks Yous!!!
US	3	2017-11-09	3.2.1	Speedyweedywoo	Decent little game	Most of the dragons are shaped like little dogs equipped with weird block shaped heads. It's an okay game. Just okay. Not as much fun as dragon city.
US	5	2017-11-09	3.2.1	very resorceful	Love this game	Love it super addictive
US	5	2017-11-08	3.2.1	Numba1boo16	Smh	Easily my favorite game but it has been force closing all morning and it's annoying I'm missing out on timed events smh
US	5	2017-11-08	3.2.1	Fat seals	👍🏽	Fun
US	5	2017-11-07	3.2.1	Mister mishu	Great game	Super fun
US	5	2017-11-06	3.2.1	oronagirl	Dragon mania legends	I think this game is really cool and fun and I love how there's different event and how you can win really nice dragons from those.
US	4	2017-11-06	3.2.1	Morticia89	Fun but OMG the Ads!	When I first started playing this a few weeks ago, the ads weren't too bad. The last update a few days ago has the ads popping up at least every 60-90 seconds! Uncool! I'd happily pay a couple dollars to go ad-free. I'm sure most other users would as well, but I've seen nowhere to be able to purchase a version like that. I love the dragons and building the levels, but the ads are overrunning the game and I really have little desire to play anymore.
US	1	2017-11-06	3.2.1	amapps10	3rd Update: Crashes are FRUSTRATING	"Update: I have won the same battle in the Halloween event twice now and every time I try to open the chest the game ""loses connection"" and then crashes and I have to wait over twenty minutes to do the same battle I just won all over again. Seriously this is the third time I've sent a review about crashes and they are the same if not worse.

I love this game, but the crashes are killing me. Once again, I'm in the middle of a battle and the game crashed. I lost 2 lives because it was a heroic battle. This happens at least a couple times a week, and not just with battle lives. I've lost food, gold, and even time. I had to repeat 10 minutes of the game last week because it crashed and instead of losing stuff, I lost progress. This really needs to be fixed."
US	5	2017-11-06	3.2.1	the margan b	Awesome	This game is amazing i have to say this is just as great as dragonvale trust me you would love to get this  game the feeling of fighting the vikings dragons is amazing and the cute dragons that you can collect are absolutely adorable i suggest thos game to anyone looking to have fun
US	3	2017-11-05	3.2.1	Kjcjnncj jdnjdekjnkfkhb ad	Cute game,but...	"So yeah it's really good game some of the dragon are SO KAWAII! But you guys make waaay too many of the dragons cost GEMS!, it's hard for people to earn that amount of gems and I don't think they wanna buy gems so please all I ask is that you guys make more of the d agony cost coins(or ""gold"" as you guys call it) and I mean that your game is horrible, I just mean you're making way too many of the dragon cost gems.BYE BYE!😜"
US	5	2017-11-04	3.2.1	4alex1989	So fun and addicting!	The game is  so colorful and amazing. I just wish it was easier to earn more dragons. But overall, it's a great game and is easy to play and understand for all ages. I highly recommend this game.
US	4	2017-11-04	3.2.1	Pokemonsega	One suggestion	Can you take out the ad that is just a black screen please it is very annoying
US	5	2017-11-04	3.2.1	Khammal Oussama	Game rate	Good game

US	5	2017-11-03	3.2.1	hsjshsjzbs	Love it	Lol I just do
US	4	2017-11-03	3.2.1	AnAngryAmber	Love it and hate it at the same time.	I used to love this game because it didn't have a lot of advertisements back then. But after the newest update, the game started to get a lot of ads and they are very annoying. The ads popped up every minute or so. I'm disappointed in this update and I hope you guys would fix it soon because I really like this game and if the ads keep popping up then I guess I have to say good bye to the game. I don't want to do that so PLEASE get rid of the Ads. They are not useful at all and no one pays attention to them. 💔💔💔🙁🙁🙁
US	4	2017-11-03	3.2.1	JayfeatherXstick	I love DML, but please stop with all the ads	I have been playing the game for a long time and it’s super cute. I love the events and the style. It’s a great game. They keep on adding more and more ads, though, and it’s too much. I understand that’s how the game-makers gets money, but recently my iPad started glitching and the screen is just black whenever the ads come up. The iPad is fairly new, too. It made me realize how often they show up. If you could calm down with the ads, I love the game otherwise; I’d appreciate it.
US	1	2017-11-03	3.2.1	NavyWife216	WARNING:	"Do NOT download (AD) this game unless you want to be constantly (AD) bombarded with ads every 60 seconds. Seriously, (AD) you can't even enjoy (AD) the game anymore. I can understand they need (AD) to make money, so they (AD) show a few ads to do that, but please (AD), limit how often they come up. I'm sad to say (AD) that I must delete this game until (AD) they fix it. When I can actually (AD) play again, I'll (AD) re-download. Until then, (AD) I'm done. 

*See how annoying all those ads were? That's what you get when you try to play this game!*"

US	5	2017-11-02	3.2.1	Punk hobbit	Daily fun	Game is enjoyable daily fun. Although it would be nice to hide things
US	4	2017-11-02	3.2.1	GabbyVeri	It's interesting my code:068c6e	The ads are the killer for me.
US	5	2017-11-02	3.2.1	cjwade2003	Great game!	Great graphics and gameplay!
US	5	2017-11-01	3.2.1	Wheelierider360	Awesome game	Although it takes forever to collect coins, food, and to make your dragons stronger, should be a little more simpler specially if this is a semi- kids game. But overall I recommend playing it, I give 5 stars. Also would be a way cooler game if the dragons were different!
US	5	2017-11-01	3.2.1	Jackied014	Love it	Great game
US	5	2017-11-01	3.2.1	PeaceLoveBowling	Addictive and Fun!	This has become one of my favorite games ever!!!!
US	5	2017-11-01	3.2.1	Bonzott	Exceptionally playable game!	This is my favorite game of the past two years! I find myself getting involved for much more time than other games. I am not much of a social gamer and this game allows me to play and increase levels without any in-depth interchange with others. So far, I have not run into any indications of wholesale cheating, either, something that seems to permeate other similar games. Good job!
US	4	2017-11-01	3.2.1	Gissellx2FollowOnIG🤟😏	I love it but...	The game is actually pretty good I enjoy it so much I’ve become addicted to it. The only issue I have is all these ads popping out of legit nowhere. It’s so frustrating and annoying and on top of that the ads never load so it’s just a pitch black screen like if my phone jut shut down; it makes me not wanna play the game again but I love my dragons so I gotta come back to them. Fix these ads please 🙄🙄🤘🤘🤘
US	5	2017-10-31	3.2.1	Mooncaverns	Dragonlandia	Great fun. I enjoy this. HOWEVER, when they have contests or special events, it is impossible to reach goals without spending money.  Frustrating.
US	2	2017-10-30	3.2.1	Ray&El	Fun game but alcohol ads for kids game??	My son & I love to play this game together, it’s a lot of fun & can get addicting. However, after spending over $25 for gems, I told him no more. In order to get free gems you are forced to watch ads, but why are there so many Alcoholic ads on a kids game??? My 5yr old was showing me an ad for Kahlua & saying that looks yummy. Nope, done, I don’t let him play it anymore
US	5	2017-10-30	3.2.1	Mkuzer	Melhor jogo	Melhor de todos

US	5	2017-10-28	3.2.0	Luke Skywalker101	Dragon Mania Legends	I love this game! It’s one of the best dragon games I’ve ever played! The dragons are cool and so is fighting. You just want to keep playing and playing. I would recommend this game.
US	5	2017-10-28	3.2.0	Miller girls	This game is awesome!!!	You should get this game!👍
US	4	2017-10-28	3.2.0	great job 😀😀	Goldfish	I love the game but it is always a goldfish commercial and I can't press the X so it takes for every
US	1	2017-10-28	3.2.0	Taz96again	Greedy developer	Between the constant pop ups of 15 to 30 second ads and events that favor players that have items only available for cash this game best played in moderation if u don't want to spend your money
US	1	2017-10-28	3.2.0	June-Arrowheart	"""Offensive words"""	"While this app is very fun and addicting, I have run into some problems that ticked me off quite a bit. I recently got the rainbow dragon, which I love and I wanted to name it Gay Boi, because it was a cute name. Then I got a message that said it contains potentially abusive words. ""Gay"" is an abusive word???? I think not, it's a word that expresses someone's love for another and shouldn't be taught or viewed as an insult. Yes, people use it as an insult but it shouldn't be viewed as one, this app, along with the incredibly annoying amount of adds and constant shutting down, not to mention bad customer service and an extremely faulty system of finding friends (despite the new ""easy update"") is a homophobic faulty app that needs some attention to these mistakes that I have found. Other than that I would give this app a higher rating for its fun gameplay and various amount of dragons."

US	4	2017-10-24	3.2.0	Stephen Ilten	Entertaining but...	The game is fun and looks good graphically but all the ads are annoying and interrupt game play a lot. Plus now the ads are glitchy and I have to close the game and restart for the ad to close or part way through the ad it resets and the ad starts all over.

US	5	2017-10-22	3.2.0	xNovale	Love This Game	I love this game and all but I hate that you have to wait 15 minutes or more for upgrades and other stuff. I still love this game though so keep up the good work! :)
US	5	2017-10-22	3.2.0	Brih12123	Cool	Love it
US	4	2017-10-21	3.2.0	GI_Jo	Fun but....	I really enjoy this game. There's a lot to do and you can tell the developer(s) and creator(s) put a lot of time and effort into it. Just a few things I dislike: 1) as you level up your dragons and get through the levels on the islands, it takes more food to feed them and you don't get the same reward because it gets harder to feed them. 2) the ability to buy farms stops at a certain level and only allows 12 max farms. This isn't enough to keep up with feeding the higher level dragons. 3) the worst part!! Anytime you check a text or put the game on pause to take a phone call or anything, it starts the game or battle or anything over!! It goes back to the loading screen and you don't get back to where you left off. It's so frustrating
US	5	2017-10-21	3.2.0	lunapirate	Love it!	Love it!
US	5	2017-10-20	3.2.0	Greatsaber	Epic	It’s a good game I enjoy it
US	5	2017-10-20	3.2.0	BPWalks	Super Fun	This game is great. There are so many little challenges and my kids love it!
US	4	2017-10-20	3.2.0	Sweet Kiwi	Fun and decently balanced	"Having played other in-app purchase games, I was hesitant to try this at first because most games seem to stack the odds against you, making you feel pressured into micro transactions. However, the dynamic of the game is mostly single player, so it allows you to tackle it at your own speed. Is it sill tempting to spend money to give you an edge in contests? Of course! But, you can still enjoy the game without having to participate in the community events. 

I enjoy the ""rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock"" approach to the combat! And the endless combinations of entertainingly-designed dragons keeps the game fresh. 

The biggest qualm I have (currently) is the enchantment league. I understand the mechanics and how it makes it different from the rest of the mini games, but it's frustrating to see a challenger's ""featured defender"", enter into the challenge, then find two dragons in that they have a dragon 5-10 levels higher than the featured defender's level. This usually results in instant defeat, no matter which potions/dragons you brought with you. It makes it difficult to even want to participate consistently. It's not a deal breaker though. I just don't play that game mode that often anymore. 

So all in all, solid little game :)"
US	3	2017-10-20	3.2.0	Garry4457	DML	Like the game and dragons. Gold and food amounts need to be raised.
US	5	2017-10-20	3.2.0	Horse Lover 2.o	Such an amazing game!	This is one of my favorite games! I play it ALL the time! I don't really mind the ads or the in app purchases. I recommend this game to all dragon lovers who are interested in spending some of their time breeding and fighting with dragons. 🐲
US	3	2017-10-19	3.2.0	Poopiepoopoofacepoo	Fun for casual, non competitive	If you're not paying actual money, nothing is leveled correctly. Yeah, dev's should get their due pay for making a game, but isn't that what the ad's help with? That honestly play about every 1-2 minutes? Whatever, it's fun when you're bored af.
US	4	2017-10-19	3.2.0	Tylerboy77	Good game	It feels similar to monster legends or dragon city but I'm addicted.
US	5	2017-10-19	3.2.0	أشكروكم	Kurdistan	Good

US	5	2017-10-19	3.2.0	Memyselfndotti	AWESOME TIME MANAGEMENT GAME!!	If you like time management games, this one is for you! Lots of different challenges within the app, arena, battle map, enchantment battles, even petting your dragons earns you coins or gems. You won't regret it, download today!!  DRAGONTASTIC GOOD TIME!!
US	4	2017-10-18	3.2.0	chefcreeper	Almost perfect	Could be better with less ads and make the planet dragon breed able for a month rather than buying for 100 dollars please
US	5	2017-10-18	3.2.0	Mimi Frozen	Addicting, Challenging, Great Teamwork	"I have been playing for almost 950 days and I'm still having fun every day. New updates creating cool challenges, imaginative dragons, and events. There are so many different opportunities of bonuses, challenges or tasks that you really can’t be bored.  The best thing is our clan, a group of individuals from all over the world that enjoy the game together, fight battles against each other as well as fight together against other clans. Mine is ""Apple”. We offer tips and support in the game as well as life. We require members to play not just tag along. If you are an established player of 75 or higher and interested in playing the game to support your clan then come join us and I will see you in the ""Arena"" to battle."
US	2	2017-10-18	3.1.1	RebeccahAnne	Fun but annoying	"Recently found the game, and there are so many aspects I love.

Here are the 2 big things that are so annoying that I’m almost ready to delete the app:

1. I have a few enchanted dragons, but I keep getting paired with opponents in league battles who have dragons at level 30-36... my highest dragon is 26, then 25, then 22, 20. My last opponent was able to have 5 dragons at battle... and I’m only allowed 4. I can’t seem to win ANY enchanted battles. Why can’t they make the pairing more fair?? Of course I will lose to if I’m outnumbered and way below their levels.

2. And this is related to leveling up, it’s impossible to get enough food to level up your dragons. I saved up more than a week to get my level 25 to a level 26. 

If you pay, the frustrations are likely reduced. But the costs aren’t worth what you’re getting. Please fix some of these things."
US	1	2017-10-18	3.1.1	The people cool	Badddddd game	So many adds and it glitches a lot dumb game but cool dragons
US	3	2017-10-18	3.1.1	GlitterandAnxiety	Different Platforms	My boyfriend and I really love this game. However, i happen to have IOS and he has Android. I think its really unfair not to be able to play together. Especially because he had just spend tons of coins to make a clan for us and we figured out we can’t be friends. I really hope this issue gets fixed in the near future.

US	4	2017-10-15	3.1.1	zebra2606	So addicting but...	I do have a problem with there being so many ads and another problem is that I have to keep downloading more data so that I can battle and that is a major problem for me. But I do love the fact that gems are pretty easy to get and the dragons look so amazing. But this is a word for the makers of dragon mania, could you please fix all the ads I get one every minute and I also do request that you should not have to download so much to get more battles you literally only go to like a battle seven and then you have to download more things. So that’s literally the only reasons that I’m giving it a four out of five so I do ask if the makers could fix the ad problem and the problem with having to download stuff so you can keep battling I think that it should not have to be downloaded but overall it is a great game and the graphics are amazing.

US	1	2017-10-07	3.1.1	Smallt0wngrl	DONT WASTE YOUR TIME	What to say. DM has gone from leaning toward pay to win, to being exclusively pay to win. Their sorting system for their events is so mismatched I don't even try anymore. When the first 100 places are all AT LEAST 50 million ahead of me, while actively participating, there is a problem. They either need to develop a system to more evenly match players, or eliminate the player against player event. I don't mind buying boosters here and there to give me a little edge, but once it became clear that it was impossible to keep up with the pack without it, I completely stopped investing. They got too greedy, and people are fed up. I can't remember the last time I even had a chance with an event, so why participate at all. The enchanted league events, I'm matched up with dragons AT LEAST 10 levels ahead of me, and not enough enchantment pieces with the free chests to give me a fighting chance. So my choices are hack, pay, or give up and I'm not rich, I like my warranty, so guess what my decision is..........
US	4	2017-10-06	3.1.1	Hddhusnxzjjd	Super fun! But one problem...	I love this game a lot and it's really cut
US	3	2017-10-04	3.1.1	^^vandy^^	Dragonmania mania	The two new islands are extremely to high. Costs way to much to feed the dragons, once their levels get higher. To upgrade things is over priced. It's discourging to young children to continue.

(By the way right now the ads are for My Little Pony so you might want to get to know your audience a bit better)"
US	5	2017-10-01	3.1.1	Nicolemarie89	Addicting	"Definitely love the breeding of all the dragons- mixing Elements and such to create. My son got me hooked on DML and now I can't stop playing.

One issue I am having though is it won't connect to my FB and not sure why :(... just continues to load then errors out."
US	4	2017-10-01	3.0.1	Hippiecatking	Love it!	Love it and I have a ton of rare dragons! (Levels 14 at the most in training right now) this game is so addicting and I love the graphics! Keep up the good work!
US	4	2017-09-30	3.1.1	TabiKaye	Zero trust for enchanted battle matches anymore	UPDATED: Love the game, feel like it has become more generous but the enchanting battle system still has issues with matching battles. The potions sometimes help, but it’s completely unfair to match me with impossible battles again and again and force me to pay to try and and find something I can win without losing all of my fighting dragons for the day, only to be tricked into a battle with dragons 10-15 levels higher than me that force me to retreat or lose and lower my standing in the league. I have NO TRUST for any of these matches and it’s to the point where I’d rather ignore that part of the game entirely. Trying to fight a match is a huge toss up that stresses me out more than a phone game app should. The game continually improves, but this is just getting ridiculous.

US	1	2017-09-20	3.1.1	jessiaca	To much work when you get to a higher level.	"I do the 4 day food and it will get my dragon half of a level. He is only about a level 56. The 4 day food takes all the money I was able to make in that time frame. I also have played on and off for two years (competing with someone) and I have yet to be able to get the last shard!!!!!!!!!!! I emailed them and all I got back was ""sorry we can't help"". Ok thanks!!   Don't waste your time."
US	1	2017-09-20	3.1.1	SloppyTuna	☠️Worst Dragon App☠️	There ate SO many awful things about this app I don't know where to begin. Don’t bother with app ~ there are much better breeding/battle apps. This one is just a greasy money grab with concepts ripped off from better games.😉

US	3	2017-09-16	3.1.1	MySadSoul	Good game but...	Good game cute dragons. But why so many ads. Ads to spin a wheel. Ads pop up every 5 mins it seems. Ads on the bottom of your screen. This is what's killing the game for me.

US	1	2017-09-13	3.1.1	Decifer.heaven	Love it	I wrote this on an impulse, I have a tree dragon that just hatched but I can't place it in a earth habitat and it's forcing me to buy another plant habitat.This has happened with multiple dragon I can't place them in certain habitats even though they have its elements and it pisses me off. Other wise great game.

My friend code in the game is b8acc check my account It's opened, and give me my dragon or i am complaining cause this is ridiculous.
US	4	2017-09-10	3.1.1	KeiraGDunn	Love!!!! But.......	"I absolutely love this game but..... it always crashes and I 
can't buy habitats for my dragons so I always have something good breeding and I have to get rid of the egg in the hatchery.
Then the same thing happens again!!!! And these has happen for a week now and I'm tired of it. Kinda a blowoff but still fun."

US	5	2017-09-08	3.1.1	ZachMarros467	Amazing	"It's an amazing game! I've had it for two years. I'm almost level 123. Th only things I would change is how long the eggs take to hatch. Like seriously, 14 hrs for an Epic!?

And especially upgrading the hatchery. There is only one option to upgrade it. 150 Gems. In my opinion, there should be another option to use coins. So maybe about 150,000 - 200,000 gems to upgrade it, and it would only take about 5 - 6 Hours.

Other than that, Amazing game!!"

US	5	2017-09-07	3.1.1	Tnff371	Awesome	Great game
US	3	2017-09-06	3.1.1	Serenity31	Good Game	Another money pit from Gameloft.  The cost is supposed to be incurred for a lack of patience, not quite literally everything in the game.  No gold equivalents for dragons, fun to pass the time, but the free status of the game is over-featured by ridiculously inflated dragons and costs. No digital pet in the world should be worth $99.00.  Whoever invented the game has lost the pulse of the community they serve except for elites with a gaming habit.  It exploits people's digital addiction instead of compromising to make the game fun for everyone.
US	2	2017-09-06	3.1.1	r2d2lc3po	Ads stink	This game would be fun except for the ads that incessantly pop up.

US	4	2017-09-05	3.1.1	Reviewcentre	Pretty well made	A issue would be the process of waiting which is something games much like it do. It definitely needs a mini game to play for free to speed it up. Personally that is the only real issue it faces

US	4	2017-09-03	3.1.1	Kailee6	GOOD GAME  💰	"This game is really good!! 
  It's fun and time consuming when u have a little time to kill.  Anyone can play.  My daughters are 8 and 12 play and they started at 7, 11.  U can chat to clan members and send gifts, complete quests, battle other online dragons for prizes.  There's much more.  

             But I do have a few complaints.
  U have to spend real money to actually play the entire game. (It's nothing like Game of War) when it comes to putting money in ur game but it will cost u.  U also need to be in a clan (dragon clan) with other players and that could take a while to be excepted if ur at a lower level.  One last thing, acquiring food (to level up ur dragons) is very challenging.  It could take days to get enough food to level up a dragon so imagine having 50 dragons to level up. Ur constantly needing food.  Very frustrating"

US	4	2017-09-01	3.1.1	Bratrissa	Awesome Game but unreasonably priced in app purchase prices	"A little too difficult for my 8 year old daughter on her own, but that actually works out great for our ""Mommy and daughter time"" because we play it together!  Only downside is I feel in app purchase prices are mostly unreasonable options from a cost perspective, purple gem package prices went from win free gems, $9.99 option (very good package though for price), then right up to $99.99 for next package??  Not even sure what was included because as soon as I saw the price I was done."

US	1	2017-08-29	3.1.0	Socornfused	All the ads!	I can't stand all the ads. Its literally every thirty seconds. It's not even an enjoyable app. Deleted.
US	4	2017-08-28	3.1.0	Peter Anargirou	Fun for years	I've been playing this for years and really enjoy all there is to do. You can focus on battling or collecting dragons, and there are different ways to do each. I just enjoy talking about it with my friend who plays and sharing what new dragons we've obtained. I just wish I could interact with Android users! Unfortunately, Android and iOS players are completely separated.
US	5	2017-08-28	3.1.0	bhffvv	The best game ever	This is the best app I have ever played in my intire life
US	5	2017-08-28	3.1.0	Kona cat	Love the game!! Have some ideas!!	I love dragon mania legends because it is very fun and you never run out of things to do or dragons to try to get.Here are a few out there ideas you could consider to use to add a new level to the game. The first one is dragon genders. Just think about it I think it would add a whole new level to the game because you could only breed males with females and that would make the game more challenging and interesting.The second one is having a design a dragon contest. Ok I know this is a little out there but I think it would be amazing and would get people interested. How it would work is people could print out an outline of the dragon body shape they want and color it in designing there own dragon!! (You could also have them add the name of the dragon and it's elements).Then they could take a picture of it and send it to you where you could pick a winner!(the winner getting their design turned into a real dragon and added to the game, they would also get a copy of the dragon)! Thank you for listening to my ideas!
US	4	2017-08-28	3.1.0	Ffrgu	I really like this game but....	I really like this game and I play it all the time but I wish the stuff took less time to get and it was less expensive for example if I breezed the tribal dragon (which is not that high) it will take 2 HOURS which is insane also getting a farm is 1,000 coins which is a lot if you ask me
US	4	2017-08-28	3.1.0	Surfin' the Subway	Delightful Dragons	This game is so much fun! I love everything about it! The dragons are amazing and adorable, and there is never a time where there's nothing to do. The only complaint I have is that everything costs gems, which leaves me paying real money for some things which is frustrating. But overall a very fun game.
US	5	2017-08-28	3.1.0	liv514	AWESOME GAME	Love this game

US	3	2017-08-28	3.1.0	Bambi363	Fun	Very fun keeps me busy
US	5	2017-08-28	3.1.0	Lnickleb 	Dragons are the best!	The only problem I have with this game is that it has too many events going on at once! Also, you have clan business at the same time. I don't have the opportunity to play every day so it's sometimes frustrating when I want to participate but can't due to time limits.
US	5	2017-08-27	3.1.0	Fit in TX	Dragon Mania	This game is addictively fun!

US	5	2017-08-27	3.1.0	Jenskater	Very creative and fun	This is a great game because it gives choice of what to do with your dragons and actually helps you along the way. The dialogue is great and the wheel doesn't have an end so you can possibly get as much as you need from it.
US	4	2017-08-27	3.1.0	Schwansguy	Love it	I play several of these type of games and dragons are my favorite. It challenging and the battles are great.
US	3	2017-08-27	3.1.0	cupanda	The ads	This is a great game and all the dragons are so cute, but there are a lot of ads and they pop up very suddenly so I always press them. It's very annoying.

US	2	2017-08-25	3.1.0	ang	Mehhhh	Ok game, generous with gems but you will be ready to tap a quest or collect something and a pop up ad will show and BAM your out of the game and headed to the advertisement. Beyond annoying and will probably stop me from playing game. I for sure won't pay real money on this game.

US	3	2017-08-25	3.1.0	HeyImKeith	Great game with serious Ad issues	"Great idea and execution on the gameplay fundamentals. Everything has a nice polish too. It's very fun. BUT the ads are a huge issue. Ad videos pop up in the middle of gameplay which to me crosses that f2p line. You're getting money from the store so ads should be optional not forced. I'm fine with ads overall but they should be kept to a banner or my choice for a ""watch a video for a bonus"". This alone would probably bring my review down to 4 stars but these pop up ads as well as the watch for a bonus ads break consistently causing me to not get credit at best or reload the game at worst. Fix the ads and save this good game!"

US	1	2017-08-24	3.1.0	Is this taken huh	Too many ads	Too many ads.  Unplayable with my 5 year old. Literally counted 4 ads in a row back to back.  Ridiculous!!  Make a one time payment of .99 cents to get rid of ads forever and you might keep more people playing. Maybe even spend more money if we don't have ads shoved down our throats.

US	5	2017-08-24	3.1.0	la98n123	Awesome game	This is by far one of my favorite games to play but I will say once you start leveling up your dragons it cost a lot more food but that's expected.

US	4	2017-08-24	3.1.0	CJ gregoire	Lots of fun	The game is fun. I wish it was easier to get gems and food production was higher, but overall I enjoy playing.
US	4	2017-08-24	3.1.0	Lindy Lou 1959	Review	I like the game but the only complaint I have is the special events when you can only collect one item and then could have to wait up to an hour to collect another item.  You should at least be able to collect 3-5 items at one time and then have a waiting time.

US	5	2017-08-23	3.1.0	Crojo30	Awesome game	I wish you could get food faster to feed your dragons it takes to long to level them up and you don't get enough money to keep buying food and to trian your dragons and buy new islands

US	2	2017-08-19	3.0.1	Amayacd	Pretty much requires money	"I am glad that I have not put money into the game. I was tempted to get the starter bundle, but now I am glad that I didn't. I am familiar to ""pay-to-win"" games as they are pretty prevalent today. However, I have never seen a ""pay-to-win"" that is so expensive. Even spending $100 to get their best gem package would hardly let you buy anything with gems. I barely got enough to upgrade my hatchery on free gems and it took a long time. You can decide to not pay, but it will be a very, very slow game. I can only feed my best dragon once because it takes so much food and my dragons only produce so much gold. I probably could progress more if I could dedicate more time to checking in more frequently, but I work so that's not possible. Frustrating, but I have another game that I enjoy playing that is more accessible so I'll focus on that one."

US	5	2017-08-17	3.0.1	CodyTheGamer	I Love It!	"•I love this game so much! You have no idea! The dragons are so cute! Even if they lose I still love them, I just have to level them up. 
•Even though the dragon of the month is hard to breed, that's the point, it's why you have a WHOLE month to try and get it. Plus, there is a website to look up the best combinations. 
•I like how I get a free hard every 12 hours and I like the enchanting dragons. It makes them so much stronger. I also like the defenders, I like fighting people. I like the potions too, it makes it easier. 
•I like the training idea, it makes them stronger for an hour! 
•I like how you have to have a certain amount of food. So I can calculate that and wait till I have enough food and level him/her up there. 
•ONE flaw, ONLY one, it will freeze and bug out on me, I might be the only one. But it will freeze and when I exit, it will keep playing the music, after some time it will stop. It doesn't happen TOO TOO often so we're good!....for now XD 
•Anyways! I cannot wait for the new updates to come! The game to me just gets better and better :3"

US	5	2017-08-11	3.0.1	crazy gamer40	I love this app	It a good app for me it is one of those tip that are time games but a lot of people don't like it because there are not enough things to do on it.so you are on the game for 15 minutes and it's and then you can't do anything else but with DragonML there are more than three thing to do so if you want to be on the game for a hour than you can but if you can only be on it for 15 minutes than you can I have a problem with being on one game all day and that's not good but with this game yes you can be on it for a longer time but it will eventually stop you because you complete everything you're supposed to do I love it but everyone is different so what I love in a game someone can hate and you can play the game completely free even just to download it is free I love DragonML

US	3	2017-08-05	3.0.1	Hot Dragons	Dragon Mania Ledgends	This game was more fun and challenging when we could choose the gifts we wanted to send to who!  Now it is rare if we get a portal gem, which is needed to battle.  I am no longer able to keep up with the mines. Give us ways to win more portal gems, please. Oh, and while I'm at it, the amounts of food on the wheel are just a drop in the bucket considering the amount we need to keep up. I keep playing because I have my favorite dragons and I don't want to abandon them. Thanks for the special events, I love chasing things all over the map to win points. Keep trying, and pay heed to the suggestions.
US	5	2017-08-04	3.0.1	pandacornlovesyou	Awesome!	This game is addicting, fun, and cute! It's very addicting where you can put your phone down! It's very fun battling other players and growing your dragons and islands! All the dragons are very adorable which makes it 10x better

Thanks"
US	1	2017-08-03	3.0.1	Jrunner013	Good game	Overall, this is a fun game. However, the constant ads popping up is getting out of hand. There should be no need to have ads appearing every 2-3 minutes while playing the games. Why can't ads just be linked to the videos & that's it?
US	1	2017-08-03	3.0.1	Allie is baeeee	This game is awesome except...	I love this game I love to play on it with my friend except the game started glitch info while I was in the section where you can buy dragons... the game starting glitching and BOUGHT A 400,000$ DRAGON AND NOW I HAVE NO COINS! I am so MAD right now. I needed to but habitats and plant more food but now I can't! This stupid glitch DRAINED ME of my money!!!! I DEMAND A REFUND of some sort because I needed that money because I have 31 dragons to take care of and now I CANT! Thanks A LOT Gameloft.

US	5	2017-08-02	3.0.1	275937538947	So addictive	I love how this game is set up and the graphics. I love how you can interact with the dragons as well.
US	4	2017-08-02	3.0.1	Catclizm	Still enjoying it	"Been playing for about 3 years and it's still a fun game. I still love most of the dragon designs, the graphics are very pretty & well done. The social aspect isn't perfect, but it works well enough for my casual play. 

I have a love/hate thing with the enchantments. I like how much better it makes the dragons I battle with, but the chests are fairly rigged. If you added element specific ones we could save gems towards, that would help, instead of the random grab you currently get. If I'm paying for it, I'd like a little more choice in what I'm getting. 

Also a way to disenchant would be nice- I upgraded a couple dragons when enchantment was first introduced that I kind of regret. It would be nice to be able to get some of those materials back."
US	4	2017-08-01	3.0.1	Ayden4436	Fun game	The game is great, it has a lot of options and there is always a new objective or dragon to try and get. The graphics are good and the mechanics are smooth, I am kind of addicted.

US	4	2017-08-01	3.0.1	AlextheIdeakid	It's a cool game👍🏾	I really like the graphics of the dragons 🐉 But I do wish there were more activities to do on the app.Like training your pet by yourself instead of taking them to the academy,or at least be able to play and entertain the dragons;but other than that the game is pretty fun.👌🏾

US	1	2017-07-31	3.0.1	Gwfegehsnajamam	Why?	"Everything seems so ""squished"" and unfair"
US	1	2017-07-31	3.0.1	Addicted_05102013	Just keeps getting worse	"The only reason I'm still playing this game is because I've made friends in the clans. I was leader of a top-ten clan, then they switched the events to make it so we're baking recipes (how does that have ANYTHING to do with dragons?!). I left the clan because the game became stressful instead of fun and started a new, tiny clan with just a few friends.

With the newest update that was supposed to make things fair and fun for all, they've made it pointless for small clans to play. Now we're pitted against the 9th ranking clan, while we're 212th (fewer than 10 casual players)!

This is just the newest in a long list of complaints we've had. Most bugs don't get fixed (the chat has been a mess since day 1) and the support is nonexistent. My only consolation is that I've gotten myself to stop wasting money in this game."

US	1	2017-07-28	3.0.1	Sugarfire	Changing my rating from 4 stars to 1 star	They are quickly ruining the game and making it a chore to want to even log in.  Horridly executed clan siege event with no reward for winners then ask us to spend money on gems.  Insulting not to mention aggravating.
US	5	2017-07-27	3.0.1	t_vengenz	Love the game, terrible ad execution	Great game, very addicting. I only wish ads didn't interrupt so often. Many times I will click something in game but then have an ad open up in my browser. Then I have to reload the game again which gets frustrating.

US	3	2017-07-26	3.0.1	Mandiml1	Started out fun but....	So yes it starts out fun and you can do things, but it happened so fast that you can't do anything because you don't have enough of the purple jems. So you have to spend real money very quick into the game to be able to upgrade your stuff, bread my dragons, lay more eggs, just everything, & they're almost impossible to earn👎🏼

level up if you play every day. You can battle your dragons, enchant them, pet them, give them power ups, the lost goes on and on. Definitely get this game."
US	5	2017-07-25	3.0.1	TripletsMum	Belonging to a Clan Makes This Game Better	Being in a clan opens up more of this game to you; more dragons, more activities (clan quests), and camaraderie to get further in the game. Buyer beware, with or without a clan this game can be a money pit so be sure to go in with your eyes wide open. Appealing to competitive types, strategists, and collectors alike. It is possible to play without being in a clan and thoroughly enjoy the game. Same for spending money. Just be prepared to endure pop-up ad and have a lot of patience.
US	5	2017-07-25	3.0.1	Airhuntress	Best	This by far is the best dragon game I have ever played in my entire life this game is a godsend. Maybe in you're next update you could make like dragons inspired by anime

I didn't know what they were for so I looked at the help menu and it didn't give me any info about the crystals at all. I looked for any buildings or decor that would help. I still can't find any info on the crystals so if any one knows what the crystals are for, Can someone write a review?
US	4	2017-07-22	3.0.1	good re	PugLord Reviews	"It is really good but on some events there are weird crazy things flying about all over. So I'd be prepared for it. 
                     goodbye my 🐶"
US	4	2017-07-22	3.0.1	Stephaniesteph123456	Such an entertaining game!	Great game! So fun and cute. Only issue is it drains your battery/memory
US	5	2017-07-22	3.0.1	NewMummy2468	Entertaining when you can get in!!	I have full bars on my wifi and I often can't connect to play. Soo frustrated! Would be a great game if I could get to it!!
US	5	2017-07-22	3.0.1	iMike Pod	Awesome	I love this game it is so fun it makes me feel calm and happy
US	5	2017-07-22	3.0.1	Taytrhwolf	Fun	Really fun
US	5	2017-07-22	3.0.1	LaynieJean	Super Addictive	Wish I had a way to do things faster like more food or gems but it's a good balance and requires patience or delayed gratification.
US	4	2017-07-22	3.0.1	Lovedolphins!!!	Game is excellent...BUT 5️⃣➡️LITTLE PROBLEMS!!!	"👍Good Stuff:
1. Dragons are super cute and strong!🐲💪
2. Love the new events!📅
3. Super fun and addicting!📱
4. Great graphics and everything is well detailed!🎀
5. Battling is fun when you win!⚔️

👎The Not So Good Stuff:
1. Being a VIP costs sooo much!📸
2. The Dragon of the Month is too hard to breed!🐲💔🐲
3. I do not like the ads for Otto's Wheel! (Choose BETTER 
ones!📰 also the rewards in general should be much higher since everything in the game costs A LOT of money.)
4. I'm always running out of scrolls so please lower the amount to train a dragon!🐉📜
5. The enchantment awards are definitely low and always gives us the elements we don't want. Please change it so that we can choose the elements of the dragon we want to enchant. 🔆💎 

This game is very fun and I have been playing for the last two years . However there are some things that frustrate the people who play the game, which several are listed above. But overall, if you are looking for a great dragon breeding game this is definitely a 🌟🌟🌟🌟 one!!!!💖"

US	2	2017-07-18	3.0.1	Baby_Blu	Nice	The game is good but VERY expensive to maintain. Can't understand why it would cost 9000 dollars to remove a plant but 30,000 to remove one not much larger than the one before. The prices are ridiculous and after trying to breed and maintain you start to loose interest quickly. It needs to be revamped to make it affordable and worth continuing to play.
US	5	2017-07-18	3.0.1	_foreskin_	Like it	I like it
US	4	2017-07-18	3.0.1	Layla monkey bottom	I'm obsessed	Only downside is the insane amount of adds

US	4	2017-07-17	3.0.1	Yddam8769	Dragonmania	Love this game! But there are some adds
US	5	2017-07-17	3.0.1	Beppenroni	Great	I love it so much it has plenty of dragons and quest to keep you playing
US	4	2017-07-17	3.0.1	ESForenza	The game is fun but!	I really enjoy playing . The creativity of the dragons are fun. There are no bugs or glitches in game that I have seen. The only thing I really don't like is the high inflation of diamonds. The game maker makes plenty of money with this app. Always trying to get more money out of us to enjoy going deeper in game. Other than that it not bad.
US	5	2017-07-17	3.0.1	Ajacinda474	This is worth the download.	Honestly I enjoy this game a lot I'm not one for a game that takes time but I find this worth waiting for.!
US	4	2017-07-17	3.0.1	Madworld504	Cool	Good game
US	5	2017-07-17	3.0.1	Red Dragon Blaze	Great Game	I love this game. The only thing I dislike is how many gems it takes and how long the waiting times are to get food. I don't like that you have to give your dragons so much food when they get to hogher levels. Other than that, I love the game in general. Everything about it is great. I love the designs of the dragons.
US	4	2017-07-17	3.0.1	MLG KingCrab	Turning animations	Hi developer, can you please make a turning animation for the dragons please?
US	5	2017-07-17	3.0.1	Nyx.Nightmare	Great game	Good game, love playing it! No problems for me
US	5	2017-07-16	3.0.1	Katestigger	Great Game	I love the game! It is interesting, allows you to play for free or go to VIP, and also gives you a chance to do a temporary VIP. I love the battle systems thus far. My only issues are that sometimes the adds will interrupt my game play. And Will sometimes freeze up my game while I am petting my dragons or feeding them. This is a minor issue, compared to the interesting game play here. I like the type match ups as well as the area where you battle other players.
US	5	2017-07-16	3.0.1	conner_reed	Dragon maina legends	I love this game
US	2	2017-07-16	3.0.1	Brynnkitten	Love the game. Sooooo many issues tho!	I seriously love this game. I like it so much that my son started playing, too. HOWEVER, I started a clan, my son can't find my clan to join. I can't even find my clan in the search area. When I was in a different clan before, he couldn't find that clan either. Once again, I couldn't even find THE CLAN I WAS IN ON THE SEARCH AREA!! ALSO, every couple of weeks (RIGHT NOW) neither my son, nor myself, can even open the game. The last time it was over 3 days that we couldn't even open the game. My son and I had the same issues, but we play on different devices (his is google based, mind is iOS based) so it's not a technical problem on our side. And the only way to get the information to report a problem to the developers is to get into the settings to get the info WHICH WE CANT BECAUSE THE GAME WONT TURN ON! So this review is literally the only way to let them know there is a problem. We truly enjoy this game, but would really like it a lot more IF WE COULD GET IN IT TO PLAY!!!
US	5	2017-07-16	3.0.1	Gracefully_fun	I live it!	Is a great game! I got attached  to the game!

US	3	2017-07-16	3.0.1	Kbkat2004	WAY too many ads	I just started playing this game and am already frustrated with the number of ads that display. Right in the middle of doing something and an Alienware ad pops up. Super frustrating!  I realize they have to make money but geez, let's make it less annoying
US	5	2017-07-16	3.0.1	Kest21	Truly Addicting	Very addicting, but very fun game

US	4	2017-07-15	3.0.1	Amanda42dorky	Pretty awesome! But a small suggestion...	"One of the few monster breeding games that's stayed on my device for more than a week or two. I've had it for almost two months now.

The only issue I've had is accidentally selling my Radiant dragon instead of placing it in the habitat I'd just built for it and now I can't get a new one. I'd really like a way to manually reset the daily bonus counter so I can get a new Radiant dragon, because the counter does not reset upon missing a day and the only way to receive a Radiant dragon is as the gift for your thirtieth login day."
US	5	2017-07-15	3.0.1	HeroKP	Awesome	My cousin made me get this and I didn't think it would be that good. But when I started playing it I instantly became hooked. I play many different games and this is one of my favorites. :)

US	5	2017-07-15	3.0.1	Isorib	LOVE THE GAME!😎😍😇	There is about only one flaw, I hate how you have to download access and stuff! But other wise, I love this game!!! Not laggy, has good art style, good music, it's not like dragon vale or DragonCity or stuff where it spams you with adds and stuff. DML only spams like two! And it's not laggy, you can breed any dragons, etc! Recommend getting the app!
US	4	2017-07-15	3.0.1	šãrããã	great, addicting !	love the game completely but would like better/more chances to win gems for those who don't buy vip
US	4	2017-07-15	3.0.1	emmaway7	Addicting	The game is super addicting.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the number of ads is absolutely ridiculous.  You can't play for 5 minutes without some type of pop-up.  It will be the reason I quit.

US	4	2017-07-15	3.0.1	MuleLover3	Too many gems to spend	This game is great. But if I would change something , I would lower the gem prices. I mean the prices are IMPOSSIBLE to get without using rule money.

US	4	2017-07-14	3.0.1	Hdvff	Very good	Though the game seems like a recreation of Dragonvale, the addition of a campaign and the removal of opposed elements for breeding, combined with better graphics, make this far superior to its precursor

US	5	2017-07-14	3.0.1	Crispycw	My kids love it!	My kids play this game together. It has been fun for them to learn about the dragons and make decisions together about how to spend the gents and coins they earn in the game.

I have known about this game for quite some time and have played it countless times as well so I know how addictive it is and each time I start over I get farther and become an even bigger expert and the fantasy that this game offers is breathtaking and absolutely wonderful. This is way better than Dragondale or any other game that is supposed to be similar. I send high recommendations to the creators of this wonderful dragon game.

US	5	2017-07-13	3.0.1	bekag	Awesome🤗	This game is so awesome. you can do so many things. and there so many different kinds of dragons. for the most part it's really easy and has a awesome concept. and I like how you can buy food with stuff that you earn on the game instead  of everything having to be bought with real money. And there so many different worlds to explore.

US	4	2017-07-13	3.0.1	JibsMan57	Fun, addictive but frustrating	"Great game but the game money it takes to generate food is ridiculous.  

It can take two days to get enough money from the dragons to grow food & the results may allow you to upgrade one low level dragon. Weeks to upgrade a high level dragon!"

US	4	2017-07-13	3.0.1	Gskdbxuensh	It's a good game but theirs a problem	I love the game it's fun and cool but you need so much food for the higher level dragons and the food takes so long to make its ridiculous!! There is also one battle that your dragons have to be level 16 to not be able to die in one hit so I would like them to fix that.
US	5	2017-07-13	3.0.1	HCourkamp	Awesome game	Very fun, lots of elements to keep the game interesting. Dragons are completely unique, you'll want to collect them all. Great for all ages. Highly recommend.

US	5	2017-07-12	3.0.1	Sarimassalha	How good Dragonlandia is	This game is truly obsession . I love this game so much its literally my favorite game ever, its all about getting deferent amazing looking dragons and feed them and take care of them and there is habitat suitable for every dragon. And when the dragons get so strong from feeding and training and learns in the academy. You have to use it to battle other dragons from other trainers in the world that play this awesome game. You should download this game its so amazing and exiting.
US	4	2017-07-12	3.0.1	MO5482	Abfab game!	"Love the dragons. Nicest looking ones and a lot of variety. Challenging fights that practices your strategic skills.
Ads are irritating but understandable. Would like to see an Ad free version though. Would like to see more shuffling of Ads when in Otto's lotto. Redundancy with the ads is irritating!"

US	5	2017-07-12	3.0.1	Lé Game Critic	Masterful	"This game is truly amazing. The graphics, the concept, the art. I wish I could give it 4.5 because of the amount of gems and money it takes to do simple things. Other than that I have never had a problem.
  ~Keep up the great work and make more games like this~"
US	5	2017-07-12	3.0.1	MadelynManzanares	Awesome game	I love this game so much
US	4	2017-07-12	3.0.1	PrEpPeR CrYsTaL	Good game	This game is fun! However I was very disappointed that I can't play with people on devices different than mine. Poor programming there.  Also prepare to constantly have opportunities to spend real money dangled in front of your eyes. But, still a good game! Fun to play.
US	5	2017-07-12	3.0.1	Leya llama	Addicted	Here's hasn't been a day where I haven't played since I got the game I'm seriously so addicted to this game
US	3	2017-07-12	3.0.1	doublenickle59	Fun, but too many ads	I really enjoy this game, but the ads are ridiculous. They pop up way too often, interrupting the flow of the game. It gets pretty frustrating sometimes.
US	5	2017-07-12	3.0.1	TeamPlasma70	Fantastic Game!	"Great fights and great events!

They're really fun but challenging too! ;-)"
US	3	2017-07-12	3.0.1	DrKnight178	It has potential	I like the game but the fact that it keeps crashing on me has me a little bit irritated. It would be better if you didn't have to have VIP status to avoid adds
US	4	2017-07-12	3.0.1	210555	Cute graphics, too many ads	Cute dragon graphics and the basic gameplay is fun enough to put up with all the ads. Nevertheless I wish I could pay for an ad free version.

Soooo many ads like every 2-3 mins and lag with ads too
Started out slow - give little gold and really expensive with gems for everything to level faster 

I played for a day then gave up."
US	5	2017-07-09	2.9.0	Domin473r	Love this game	I've always loved this game it's original and it doesn't just copy the same dragon over and over just different colors
US	4	2017-07-07	2.9.0	BJZMan2008	Sooooo good!	I love this game so far but I just started so maybe I'll rate it different later when I play it major but it's a good game! I just don't like the rating.
US	5	2017-07-07	2.9.0	Coltin N	Awesome game	I just started and I'm already haveing fun the directions in tutorial are easy to remember and anyone could have fun even younger kids.
US	5	2017-07-07	2.9.0	XboxDad	Really clever combination of light battles and resource developing	Take the battles from DC Legends, the family farming from Ice Age, and the layout developments from Sims City Buildit ... and you have this cute game for the whole family.

US	4	2017-07-05	2.9.0	LeDiableBlanc10	Just bought the game	I was looking for a game just to pass the time between my Disney game and I found this one. It's a little like Dragonvale if you guys remember that. My only problem with the game is everything is so high costing i.e. Gems, food, other dragons. It just seems like they purposefully make Like that so you have to purchase gems and things. Other than that I'm liking it!
US	4	2017-07-05	2.9.0	Foxes77	This is one of the best games I've ever played.	"I love this so much! It's fantastic, but I'd like to point out some problems I have with it.
First off, the boss at Steam City is impossible to beat. It kills my level 10 dragons in 1 hit, and I don't know what to do. I feel like instead of having it level 20, have it level 15 at the most with more chances to miss.
Another problem is everything costs a bit too much gold, and I feel it's rude to have everything costs too many gems. Most of us don't have money, may I remind you.
Also the problem with the VIP is the fact that some events require VIP, which is ridiculous in my opinion. Events should be for everyone.
And the last problem is Facebook. The reason I do not have it is because it's unsafe, like Twitter, Snapchat, FaceTime, etc.
I feel the Facebook thing shouldn't exist.
That's all I have to say!"
US	5	2017-07-05	2.9.0	Shelbs Johnson	Love it!!	This is a great amazing game. I love it.

US	4	2017-07-04	2.9.0	TOO MUCH ADS!!!!!!!	Too many ads	I love the content of the game. It's nice and relaxing but the only problem is that there is way too many ads and I find them really disturbing. Sometimes I would begin training one of my dragons but then a ad comes up and when I close it, the screen glitches and I have to wait and redo the training again.
US	5	2017-07-04	2.9.0	Sofia778899	I love it!	I love this game!! It's so fun and addicting! For all the parents who want to get their kids this game, It's worth it! There is one bad thing though... you have to wait for the portal to refill.. but i give it 10/10! Love it!
US	4	2017-07-04	2.9.0	Dinosaurlady	Holy Ads Batman	Fun so far, but the constant advertisements are obnoxious.  Would gladly pay for a way to play ad-free.

US	5	2017-07-04	2.9.0	nikiGyUP	Love BUT don't love it	The game is awesome I spend most of my time on it BUT I'm on level sixteen and it says I have the maximum number of habitats built but I don't have the maximum number of habitats built it's not fair. I have an egg in the hatchary and I can't get it out because I have to be a sertan  level for this and a sertan this for that and I don't find it fair so also you need to level up faster and the level I'm on for fighting is a little hard so I just want the dragons that I fight to be a little easier not a whole lot just a little because I've been stuck on it for months but over all this game is so addicting and I just can't stop playing BECAUSE I LOVE it SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH😍🤗
US	5	2017-07-04	2.9.0	RB Rebel Girl	This is a very AWESOME game!!!😆	"I don't wanna write a lot but I can say that this game is a lot of fun! My favorite part is that the dragons 🐉 turn from cute to cool 😎.

It deserves a good rate and I hope everyone loves this game as much as I do.
US	3	2017-07-03	2.9.0	khriz khrozz	Ads ads ads	I like this played couple days n got to level 13. Easy to get gems and dragons but the ads coming up and interrupt you is no fun. I would keep but going to uninstall because of all the ads. I'll stick with monster legends I'm level 90 there

Made by: County Kiki"
US	4	2017-07-01	2.9.0	Spelt wrong on purpose.	Pep talk?	OK, so this game used to be ALOT better when it didn't have the pop-out-of-nowhere ads, and ITS ANNOYING!! and u can't even get away from it ether!! So pls, get rid of the ads!!

DRAGONS + GOOD GAME = HECK YEAH

This game pretty much has no flaws. Minus the enchanted tournaments where people put up a dragon that seems your level when in reality they have dragons 20 levels higher than you xddddddd

(I really hope that gets fixed by the way)

In the meantime, I'm just gonna sit here and be obsessed with dragons.

Cue the dragon emoji spam

US	5	2017-06-29	2.9.0	Laybug_667	Fun and Addictive	It is very addicting I haven't stopped playing it for the past few hours. I really love this game it's a good way to pass time while having fun! I don't know if everyone shares my opinion but that's OK.
US	5	2017-06-29	2.9.0	-stitch-	Entertaining	I had the game for a while but had to factory reset my phone and I had a limited edition dragon but lost it when I had to start the game over. I'm sad I had to restart the game but oh well. It's my favorite game and the dragons are really cute and I would definitely recommend this game.

US	4	2017-06-29	2.9.0	CreekElf13	TO MANY ADDS!!!!	I love this game!!! But there are sooooooo way to many adds popping up every two minutes.  And everything is soooooooo expensive when you go higher up in the game. It's ridiculous. But I love the game, the graphics are great, the dragons are a adorable, but there are way to many adds popping up as I'm trying to do something.
US	4	2017-06-29	2.9.0	🙂unicorn	Clan War Bummer	My brother and I enjoy this game, but wish after each clan war you could save materials for the next.
US	4	2017-06-29	2.9.0	MovieMila	Super FUN	I like this game me and my cousins play it with each other , I don't like that I have to connect to Facebook in order to get a special dragon and I can't have my face , Not quite sure what the VIP Does but lol ok anyways I like it the dragons r cute and I like the stickers that come with the game , still could b better 🤗😇
US	5	2017-06-29	2.9.0	Little billy the satanist	It's fun ig	I mean it looks great, is easier by far than the windows version, and is great fun but it's basically adware because every two things I do gives me an add and some don't even have x's and I have to exit completely. I loved this game back when  it wasn't so filled with ads and still was so much fun like it is now.
US	4	2017-06-29	2.9.0	Leedle :]	Too Many Ads	I love this game, it's cute and funny and easy to play and easy to understand. The artwork is great and it works very smoothly. But my major complaint is that I think being interrupted every few minutes for ads is ridiculous. I don't mind watching ads to get a daily reward or to use the lottery, I don't mind watching ads to get more stuff or paying for gems or whatever. But when every few minutes I'm on the game is interrupted by an ad that can't even load because I have such slow internet, it doesn't seem fair. And then I accidentally click these ads because it pops up when I'm doing something. I'd literally pay for the pop up ads not to be there. I'm sure their ad revenue is more than enough without frustrating their players!!!
US	3	2017-06-29	2.9.0	(Jazmin77)	Love the game hate the ads	The game is great! It's creative, fun, and challenging. Please get rid of the ads, the game almost requires in app purchases in order to continue advancing, so the ads make zero sense. Especially the ads about alcohol, isn't this a kids game?
US	4	2017-06-28	2.9.0	pixpidania	Dragon mania	I love the game but the adds are the worst
US	1	2017-06-28	2.9.0	Kitty:3girl112233	Copying.	All of these games dragon city, dragon mania legends,etc are all just copy's of DragonVale. Come up with your own game idea

US	3	2017-06-27	2.9.0	JimiDragon	Connection issue when battling.	It seems that when I battle, the connection is disrupted as soon as the battle ends and the screen reloads. It uses up my points and potions but does not give me credit for a successful battle. I can not advance without completion. I am right next to my wifi also, but that does not help.

US	1	2017-06-26	2.9.0	Lunababe26280417	Good game-too many ads	I've played this game for a while now and even spent money on it.. and it plays ads about every five minutes now. Drives me nuts. Too bad, because it was quite a good game.
US	3	2017-06-26	2.9.0	Superman1234567890!!!	TOO EXPENSIVE	The gold, food, and gems are too expensive. All of the ads though that is a different story, a way worse story. With all of the expensive things then I can't even buy the dragons I can't breed. And it won't let me breed any of the dragons of the week or of the month. Plus it gives you a automatic friend that levels up so fast you feel behind an that leads to feeling bad. The hatchery takes forever and ever. It also is way to much to upgrade. Somebody better fix before everyone quits using it. But minus all that and the game is not too bad.
US	5	2017-06-25	2.9.0	Vasiliki Karampouli's	The best game!	I love this game! It is really fun! All the dragons are so cute, the decorations and the different lands! You can battle, breed and have fun!! I used to have it on my tablet, but it broke so now I have it on my iPhone! I used to be at lever 40, and now here I am again!!! I am enjoying this game so much!!

US	5	2017-06-25	2.9.0	Joe. Dude	Fantastic.	This is a great game. The graphics are incredible, the gameplay is pretty neat, and the dragons are more adorable than ever. This game is bent on world domination. My only problem is the temptation of making purchases to get even more adorable dragons.

US	4	2017-06-21	2.9.0	angels_song	Great game! But to much ads...	I love the game! Its so much fun collecting, attacking and clicking, but there are WAY to many ads! If it weren't for the ads I would give it 5 stars. But, I'm fine with a little ads. Lemme tell you what ads do: pop out of nowhere, they are annoying!

US	5	2017-06-18	2.9.0	Tail stars	Great game	It's a good game for kids and adults. The only problem is that in the ad for it they didn't really speak of fights and that stuff.
US	5	2017-06-18	2.9.0	malia cute	The best ever	I started playing like a noob but its easy to ge used too
US	5	2017-06-18	2.9.0	Carson or CC	Best Game	Now this game is awesome. Right when I started playing I could not stop playing. The art style is awesome. The concept is good. It's just a good game. But the thing I love most about this game is that it's really easy to get gems and breed epics and legendary dragons. In most dragon games, they make it so you have to spend money to get gems and get rare dragons. And the time for breeding and hatching dragons is the best! The most it would take to breed and hatch a legendary is 2 days and 9 hours. In a lot of games, it would take like 5 days to breed a rare. Those games want you to spend money. Now is game, it wants you to keep playing so it made getting gems really easy and breeding dragons, fairly easy. I'm so glad I found this game. But one last thing, I would like it better if you only had to be level 10 to be able to join a clan and if it would be easier too because I have a friend who plays and they are lower level and I want them to join my clan. And I want to be able to name myself in the game without using a google account or anything like that. But I'd recommend it for anyone who has not played it. Now I'm going to go play Dragon Mania Legends
US	5	2017-06-18	2.9.0	Star laugh	Very fun and great to play	It is very interesting and it teaches responsibility and is very fun I definitely recommend it to kids who like these types of games

US	5	2017-06-17	2.9.0	Dr J La	I LOVE DRAGONS	This game is ardorable and I love it! Just things cost a little bit to much with gems but besides from that I love it!!!!
US	1	2017-06-17	2.9.0	Charlotte yay	Waiting simulator	The game involves a lot of waiting. In one instance it took the game five minutes to load, and after that the game was extremely laggy. The game play is also very lacking. Also you need a lot of gems to get anything done efficiently in this game. But the thing about gems is that they appear very rarely in game and they are very expensive to buy. Another thing that bothers me is that the game has a VIP access that allows you to get more loot and special dragons. The thing is is that you have to use gems to get it. For example a two day VIP pass is 49 gems or the equivalent to 1.24 USD per day.Over all this game isn't very good and there are other games that do what this game is trying to do much better.

And send me stuf please 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼."
US	3	2017-06-14	2.9.0	Coolkid4913	Good game, too slow	"I love the graphics and gameplay of this game, especially the battling aspects of it. The dragons are even adorable too and not too difficult to collect early on, although it does get more difficult when you start going for the rarer dragons.

My problems with this game are the ads, the slowness, and how time consuming it can be! The ads pop up way too frequently and some are actually kind of disturbing. It takes a while to progress in the game. Later on it takes days for eggs to hatch, and leveling up the hatchery costs way too many gems! Did I mention how expensive the gems are? The game is so time consuming too and I find myself getting bored at some points.

Overall, I love this game, but as you can obviously see I have some issues with it. I hope the developers will improve these things in the future!"
US	5	2017-06-14	2.9.0	Star111014	It. Sooo. Much. Fun!	Well when I first got the game I was expecting it to be like nope game but BOY I was wrong! Very wrong...And I'm sorry for that but now I play it a LOT more then I should. I love the dragons when their baby's. (THEY ARE SO CUTE!) Highly recommend this game for lovers of dragons and to time waiters, this game is the best! I was a bit confused at first on breeding them but then I found the book in the opinions that was very handy now I totally understand it now. And so for I have no glitch problems or lag problems it works smoothly. I think my favorite dragon in the game (So far.) is the metal dragons. But I love the game!

US	3	2017-06-13	2.9.0	CloudytheCat	Amazing game, Horrible Ads	I used to play this game before they added the Totem of Friendship and the Lighthouse. It was an amazing game that would borderline Pay to Win but could pretty much be fully played without buying anything. At least if you were patient enough. I just recently got back into it and am rather disappointed in the amount of ads that forcibly pop up every two minutes or so. You'd think that since they've gotten bigger, with more players, therefore more money coming in, they wouldn't need to rely on ads like that. It'd be much better if they went back to ads that you could watch if you wanted to. All in all, superb game, but the ads take the fun out of it.
US	3	2017-06-12	2.9.0	Mistress Zee	Fun game	This game is good for killing time. It's fun, but things cost too much in game coin and gems.
US	3	2017-06-12	2.9.0	lkkillian	Entertaining	"I enjoy playing this game but I have two major complaints; gems are too expensive and the free ones are hard to come by, they want you to spend a lot of money and the ads, ads, ads. Very frustrating to be interrupted every few minutes by ads. Progress is slow going. I refuse to spend money on a game for fear that once I start spending money there is no going back. You have to feed your dragons to level up and food is expensive. The ads are annoying I usually 
end up closing and playing something else. There is a lot of things you can do as far as progressing forward but you have to be patient or spend money. The graphics are good, the dragons are cute. I have thought about getting rid of this game many times because of the cost and the ads."
US	5	2017-06-11	2.9.0	Ambrai	Fun!	Lots to do and fun to play! With clans, the heroic map, enchanting dragons for more power, and weekly/monthly dragons for breeding there is so much to try and keep you busy. It's a good background game or, if you want to keep on it, a good up front game with the gems. You can keep going and going and going.

US	1	2017-06-10	2.9.0	GO Hetalia!!!	Too Many Ads!	Listen, the game is great guys. It's addictive and has pretty much everything you could want in a dragon breeding/fighting game. The Ads however, are incredibly annoying. I've never seen an app that's shoved that many ads in your face. Mostly all apps that have in app purchases have viewing ads as an option. This app just tops the cake though (I mean really having an add pop up every 2 minutes? Some are even videos I can't skip!) it's ridiculous guys. Make viewing ads optional please. You'll be surprised on how many people appreciate that and won't uninstall your game.

US	5	2017-06-04	2.9.0	NotGross	Baby Dragons and the Fountain of Youth	"The Fountain of Youth was a great idea to take your mature and valiant dragons and bring them back to the adorable little lizards they used to be. I'm just tired of them converting back into adult dragons ""magically"" if you have to fight or train them. I think there should be new animations to let these little guys have a shot at the Big Leages."
US	4	2017-06-04	2.9.0	HighVoltage714	Fun but a little broken.	The game is fun an creative, but for the Events, I feel like the top 1-30 ranks are by people who do nothing but spend hundreds of real money dollars to reach their rankings. I'm assuming that they also have VIP, so maybe make it so that if you're VIP, you don't compete with those who aren't.
US	4	2017-06-03	2.9.0	kmccoy6531	Fun	I feel like this game would be 10 times better if we were able to rearrange everything on a mass scale. Like how on clash of clans you're able to go into editing mode and take everything off the screen and rearrange everything hassle free.

US	5	2017-05-29	2.9.0	Jjscratch	Fun game	Like collecting different dragons. It's a game you do not have to spend money on.
US	5	2017-05-29	2.9.0	I 💗🐲🐉	It's so addictive and I love it so much	It's so addictive and I love it so much, but I think it could use some more elements and some lots of my types of dragons and stuff in there to be all different resources and a more different resources and go to be like little gameplay modes where are you play versions of other games like the one in my talking hank.
US	5	2017-05-29	2.9.0	Baltazar's	Great game	I love love love this game I have been playing this game for years it is not only constantly entertaining, and creative in their expansion of the game but also they offer many opportunities for free rewards as you go along so progression is fun and easy. Only wish breeding the dragons didn't take SO many times for the elites;;) One of my top two app games of all time!!!!
US	5	2017-05-29	2.9.0	Cj212	Love this game	Love the gameplay
US	2	2017-05-29	2.9.0	Skye3650	Fix new update	Was working fine for months, now this new update won't let me download anything? Haven't been able to play it for almost a week now because all I see is the gray dragons, and when I try to download it says 'not enough space' when I know I do??? Please fix.
US	4	2017-05-29	2.9.0	Amazing fame	Amazing	It's the best game I've played so for and for the most part it's challenging
US	5	2017-05-29	2.9.0	Sierra_mist 511	Fun fun fun	Really enjoying this game , usually I end up getting bored with a game like this. I'm still really into it. And I like how you don't have to use real money to play it. Only if you want special things, but it's not impossible to do well in the game not buying anything extra.
US	5	2017-05-29	2.9.0	Calawyn	Fun	Have had no problems yet and it's super fun!
US	5	2017-05-29	2.9.0	urbanpokemon82	Awesome game but...	I LOVE this game but the  problem is the ads they pop up ALL the time when and the wait for the breeding and the hatching but other than that it's a good game
US	5	2017-05-29	2.9.0	HarleyQuinn818	Easily addicting	Fun and quick. Easy to love and leave and come back too once a day.
US	5	2017-05-29	2.9.0	HogW1ld	Love it	Love it. Still think breeding cycles are way too long for good dragons
US	4	2017-05-28	2.9.0	Samsolomon	Dragon mania legends	Fun to breed dragons and see what you get.  Have had quite a few repeat dragons.  Not easy to gain money when you are always spending money to grow food to feed dragons so they can explore.
US	5	2017-05-28	2.9.0	JocelynRazorWolf	Jocelyns review	I LOVE THIS GAME. it's awesome because u can battle other ppl
US	3	2017-05-28	2.9.0	Czhotrod	Fun game but expensive 😡	Dragon Mania is a fun game the only down side is if you want to keep up and win battles is going to cost you a lot of money

US	4	2017-05-27	2.9.0	snowjoy15	Tomeny ads	Every time I go in my game thay pop up and it's annoying
US	3	2017-05-27	2.9.0	NonplussedNixie💚	Pretty fun but eh	The game itself is adorable but the adds are incessant, jarring, and in some cases downright unnerving. The button for recording is also placed so close to the exit button that it's honestly a chore to avoid hitting it, which makes navigation a pain.
US	5	2017-05-27	2.9.0	Lynnsdragon	It's great	I love it. My daughter and grand daughter love it to.
US	1	2017-05-27	2.9.0	Nik9696	Too many ads	I've not played a game that has in app purchases that shoves this many ads in my face, even full screen video in the middle of doing something, until now. No option to pay for the game to remove them. Actually I haven't played ANY games that have in app purchases that have ads. Not sure why they need them, but tone it down. Yikes. Three times it interrupted me with full screen video in less than 15 minutes. Uninstalled.
US	5	2017-05-27	2.9.0	Stengeljjj	¡¡¡ AWESOME GAME !!!	I love this game. So much fun and many different things to do. I can not stop playing!
US	5	2017-05-27	2.9.0	Kiiiplkjhfjkh	Awesome	Very very fun game super addicting only bad thing is your encouraged to spend money to win
US	4	2017-05-27	2.9.0	Cricket One	Dark Divinity	"Update May 25,'17, 2nd review - It's still fun & I wish I had more time to play. About the only thing I don't like is all of the dragons are not available to breed. A lot can only be gotten through special events or buying them. That part is the same in most of the games-the buying part. 
1st review Fun! Much much much better game than Dragon Story!"
US	5	2017-05-26	2.9.0	aap96	The kids love it	The kids love it
US	5	2017-05-26	2.9.0	frig lady	Love my dragons	This game is very addictive and challenging. Wish could earn food faster as it is very hard to keep up with the dragons and level them up.  Cost to much to have to keep buying gems for food
US	4	2017-05-26	2.9.0	Seungwoo Biased	Me gusta	Muy bueno ..

US	5	2017-05-26	2.9.0	SALaura	Lots of fun	This is a fun game and the dragons are adorable. The fights require skill and strategy. There are lots of game elements to keep it interesting. This is a fun game for the whole family.
US	5	2017-05-26	2.9.0	emtheg	Awesome	Its lit
US	4	2017-05-26	2.9.0	JBFerrell	Enjoyable!!	My 4yr old son and I love this game!! Learning more about an elements strengths & weaknesses and combining each dragons skill(s) to create another. Watching the dragons grow up as you feed them and sending them to battle, plus you can increase their skills by sending them to the academy.  However, the gem packages and being able to collect enough food to level up your dragons is not cheap and they rarely have good deals unless you buy a dragon pkg, which is still pricey.
US	3	2017-05-26	2.9.0	GrammaBop	Fun game, kind of a rip off with gems	"I would give 5 stars because it is a blast to play. With that said, my complaint is that everything costs so much gems, and the gems are very expensive. I think you should be able to buy the food with coins. The farms don't give you enough food to help your dragons level up. Everything uses gems and a lot of them so if you don't buy them you might as well not play. This game could be much better if you didn't have to have so many gems.
I think the developers are kind of being greedy. Lighten up guys you have a great game that's a lot of fun to play."
US	5	2017-05-26	2.9.0	TURKEY GERKEY	AWESOME GAME!!!!!	I love this game it's one of my favorite games!I play it every day as much as I can!I would suggest getting this game definitely!😀👍😺😄😁😆😃😝😛🤗

US	5	2017-05-25	2.9.0	SWAGG howton	Very COOL	This game is the best and I'm always on it!
US	3	2017-05-25	2.9.0	Poopsjua.B	Going great so far!	Love how it's going so far I play this game every day and I have all the dragon games but one I have dragon city, dragons wold and this one I'm writing a review of.
US	4	2017-05-25	2.9.0	Writermist	Very addicting	I love this game but I warn you...it's hard not to spend money. Some game features are annoying like how it wastes a lot of time by not allowing one to cancel unwanted eggs or how you can't do backwards fusion. But the dragons look great...the battles make you think and you can decorate your land
US	5	2017-05-25	2.9.0	SavageFireWolf11	Cool	Entertains me when bored and AMAZINGLY fun! Don't need internet connection either. I am really glad I got this app it's really good And I would say for ages, 5-100!😆
US	5	2017-05-25	2.9.0	Chaosjester69	Very Fun	Free to play easy! Not a requirement to buy anything to enjoy the game. Plenty to do and a lot of dragons to collect!
US	5	2017-05-25	2.9.0	Bourg Jones	Mom	Love this game! The whole family plays and enjoys it
US	4	2017-05-25	2.9.0	Mdf0982	Love this game, but...	...It has put a dent in my wallet! Love it, very addictive. There should be more ways to win Gems in game, and sometimes the videos don't load even with perfect Wifi signal. Otherwise, it is really fun. I have never spent so much money on any game though. Fair warning.
US	4	2017-05-25	2.9.0	EvaCreature	Great Boredom Buster	I have plenty of fun with this game. As you level up there is an increasing amount of things to do, which keeps it interesting. My only complaint is the way the game limits the amount of habitats you can build, and thus how many dragons you can have, which I find to be counterproductive to the goals of the game. But other than that, lots of fun for the whole family. My kids like to sit in my lap and help me play. :)
US	5	2017-05-25	2.9.0	MeillaElise	Dragon Game	This is one of my favorite games! It's a little slow when opening up but it's not a big deal. This game is very interactive and it's very entertaining.
US	4	2017-05-25	2.9.0	101wolftales	Great game	I'm only giving it 4 stars because it takes up way to much space and n my phone so I would like Gameloft to fix that
US	5	2017-05-25	2.9.0	TenhutXIII	Review	Awesome a lot of depth to the game
US	5	2017-05-25	2.9.0	Nrazzz	DRAGONS	This game is very fun and has lots of unique dragons to collect. I have not found any issues so far with this game. I love the fact that the game keeps evolving the more you play it. Unlocking new ways to breed dragons, leagues to compete in, leveling up dragons, and joining clans just a few of the amazing features of the game that you get the enjoyment of working towards. I would recommend this game to all of my friends and actually have!
US	4	2017-05-25	2.9.0	MizzTre	Love this game!!!	This is a very nice game if you like to constantly check or monitor something. I recommend to try...might surprise you. 👍🏽
US	4	2017-05-25	2.9.0	S3xAyB3aSt	Very entertaining	The whole family enjoys it. The dragons are cute and the battles are challenging. Only downside, I wish it gave the option to breed more dragons without having to sink $ into the game. Overall, a solid way to fill some free time.
US	5	2017-05-25	2.9.0	Astaire_sharad	SO CUTE!	I love this game but the game is so..so...the bat battles are hard
US	1	2017-05-25	2.9.0	Purplegurl777	Usually a great game	"I downloaded the most recent update and again, can't access half of the game. And lots of my dragons are grayed out. They're there, flying around but gray (with a ?). It also keeps telling me to download more...didn't I already download it? This may become another ""game I used to play""..."

US	5	2017-05-22	2.8.1	LOL charms	Amazing!	I'm absolutely addicted to this game! And I cannot stop playing it
US	5	2017-05-22	2.8.1	Anii12345	Best game ever	There are many negative reviews, or semi negative, but honestly it is the best. I have so much fun in it. Sure it takes time to complete tasks if you don't have the money for gems, but it's a very fun game.
US	5	2017-05-21	2.8.1	1223445566680	Cute	Ugly
US	5	2017-05-21	2.8.1	Little Hobert	Love	If you are a dragon fan this is a amazing game I love to play it
US	5	2017-05-21	2.8.1	Killer girl 11	Only one problem	I love this game except how long it takes to load. Other than that is game is great
US	1	2017-05-21	2.8.1	Dani Asd	Addicting but..	Very addicting game but, pop up ads are way too frequent. Having ads come up that often takes away from the game. Like other successful games- make watching the ads earn gems or something as a reward.
US	4	2017-05-21	2.8.1	The fallen chilled	Re watching	I like it but they need another way to gain stuff
US	4	2017-05-21	2.8.1	Billy G 14	Well done game	So far this game has exceeded my expectations but I hope they can add more new dragons to the shop .
US	5	2017-05-21	2.8.1	Zallison21	Really good	Love this Game!
US	5	2017-05-21	2.8.1	Boomk112	It's awesome !	No glitches, and diamonds  you have to earn them
US	4	2017-05-20	2.8.1	Heavens1950	Mrscoover	I love game, fighting the battles and hatching the dragons, leveling up all the habitats, farms etc.  However, the islands are way too expensive, it takes too long to earn the gems and the gems are too expensive to buy.  I don't understand the latest version so I don't play it. Just play the original features.  It took too long to get all the shards for Chronos too.
US	5	2017-05-19	2.8.1	MxDdiE eLiZaBeTH	So fun to play!	I love how fun it is to play with the dragons!

US	5	2017-05-18	2.8.1	Hstell	Honestly Very Fair	I read a lot of reviews before downloading this game and thought that they were kind of critical. The game is honestly very fun, and there are plenty of means to get food without spending gems if you are patient.
US	5	2017-05-18	2.8.1	PyroMancer420	Great game	Great and addictive game
US	1	2017-05-17	2.8.1	Bivol-wow	I'm disappointed	After a while, the game is boring. Too monotone, dragon battles are almost identical, don't like that if you wont to create a new type of dragon it depends to much by luck. Another disadvantage of game is that it need a strong connection to internet.
US	5	2017-05-17	2.8.1	Mayceebug	dragons	"this game is so much fun! and it's a great way to make time fly when your waiting on or for 
something"
US	5	2017-05-17	2.8.1	Bruce Dahlberger	It is  a great chill out and play game	In my opinion, I love the game. And to the people who didn't like it just didn't give the game enough time.
US	5	2017-05-16	2.8.1	Grivsvib	Interesting	Cool game
US	5	2017-05-16	2.8.1	Eric the mean	Best game	This game has been running well it is all I have ever wanted in a dragon game thank you game creators for making such a good game

US	2	2017-05-12	2.8.1	Mandy10169816	Habits are locked	I got up to level 23 before the game wouldn't allow me to purchase anymore habits no matter what I tried
US	4	2017-05-11	2.8.1	SidheAnlace	Interesting.	I like it but hate the ads that pop up when I'm trying to decide what to do. There are so many ads in this game.
US	5	2017-05-11	2.8.1	Matt_EtS2013	Time consuming	Enjoying the easy tutorial and quick leveling system. Breeding is easy as well. Its easy to get to level 10 with using barely any gems at all. Like it so far :)
US	3	2017-05-11	2.8.1	Datre 🐭	It's ok	Good game but there are random ads popping up when I'm in the middle of something! And also a lot of things are overpriced, like 150 gems to upgrade something! And also the game has a glitch that sets your game back a little bit. Please fix this, and also a suggestion, let us choose the island we want instead of having to pay 2.5 million coins for some random island. Let us choose the 2nd island of our choice and so on. And also there is an ad where the x button is too small to push! Get rid of those random ads in gameplay! If you want money make things less expensive!

Awesome game, especially after you join a clan. You get help from everyone and advance quickly. My clan is in the top 24 of all the clans, and we usually place 1st or 2nd in the dragon races.
US	5	2017-05-08	2.8.1	TigerPrincess2	So cute and fun!	I love games like this! :D
US	5	2017-05-08	2.8.1	Raghuathi	Awesomeness	Great game well thought out
US	5	2017-05-08	2.8.1	booboo fletcher	Amazing	There is no glitches and itis so funn
US	3	2017-05-08	2.8.1	ZeleronX	Decent Game Overall	"In this game you buy and breed various species of Dragons. From farming food for them to upgrading them and their environment the game can get a little addicting. But it can also get very tedious.

Petting each Dragon individually for some extra gold seems like a good idea in theory, but once you've traced higher levels and have more than 20 Dragons, it just gets annoying and makes me wish the petting of them were removed altogether.

The game also has a very high tendency to push using real money in it. While I don't mind some freemium models this game can get a bit excessive with it. On IOS ads pop up occasionally out of no where for no apparent reason and the long breeding timers entice people to spending a lot of money on an otherwise free game."
US	4	2017-05-08	2.8.1	Shelby2u	Enjoy playing, but...	I truly enjoy the process of breeding the dragons, feeding and the battles.  The only real issue that I have is the petting. In the beginning petting the dragons was cute and kinda fun.  However, once my dragon numbers increased to the current level, it's become an absolute chore!  I would love to have the ability to just press one button to pet.

US	1	2017-05-06	2.8.1	Grimholde	Ads, Ads, Ads	Far too many ads popping up at the most annoying times. Too many for a game with micro transactions.
US	5	2017-05-06	2.8.1	224536	Good game	I love this game
US	5	2017-05-06	2.8.1	Paul1771	It's a good time waster	If you have nothing to do it's pretty fun to play this game. You can get pretty into it.
US	2	2017-05-06	2.8.1	Gramma Gayle	Someone keeps signing into my account	"Why does it take so much gold to feed these dragons?  Even my grandson is bored playing at 4 years old!   Plus ""petting"" the dragons 3x each to collect it's gold, takes too much time.  Why not make it work with just one swipe?  This could be better/easier. This game makes you work for everything, not that I mind working but that is 15 dragons at level 30!?  Something else to eat a lot of food=more gold to buy. 
Mine are now eating 221,000 a bite!  Takes awhile to replenish.
Why do I keep playing?  I wish I knew.  Even the dragons are becoming more difficult to obtain.
  I don't play as often because it's just getting to be work instead of fun.
I guess I would just like for things to move along a little faster rather than waiting 2 days to get enough food to feed the dragons, and even at that it barely feeds them anything, oh well it's something to do when I'm bored!

I was awarded the Frefly Dragon for playing a year, where is it?  I looked in the inventory box,nope, and then checked the dragons, not there either, and it's so cute!  What do I do? 

Not playing as much at level 93.  I just have other things to do like work!  Guess I'm bored.

I still play just not as religiously as I used to.  Once the dragons get to a certain level it takes forever to get them to the next level.  How some people have dragons at level 60+, 
And why on this new game the dragons with a low level get so many stars?  And then it's starting all over again!  Why can't I get my higher dragons starred, ridiculous!  It would be a lot more fun to play.  Is the game rigged?

Never did receive the free dragon for playing more than a year.
It's still really difficult to get my higher leveled dragons starred, but not the lower leveled dragons, what a pain!"
US	5	2017-05-06	2.8.1	IDuzzzStuffz	Yes. Just yes.	I absolutely love love love this game!!Do yourself a favor and get it now!!

US	4	2017-05-03	2.8.1	Flexilexi123	I love this app!	If anyone wants to try to see if this is better than dragon city... it is. But there is a downside. The app takes a big load of data.
US	5	2017-05-02	2.8.1	Neza Martinez	SO FUN	YAY
US	5	2017-05-01	2.8.1	Jermey8889	Love it	I enjoy the game so much I hope everyone does to
US	5	2017-05-01	2.8.1	Sting Ray R27	Sting Ray R27	I think the time it takes to hatch an egg is way too long and how much money or gems it is to update a building is WAY too much.But over all it's pretty addicting to play!!!!!
US	4	2017-05-01	2.8.1	Wolfiewow23	One or two gaps...	"OK, so it's good-except for a gap or two. I'll list them below:
-gems are REALLY, REALLY rare.
-all the good dragons are WAY to expensive.
That's all I could think of listing. Now, one more thing-the constant ads. One moment, I'm feeding a dragon. Seconds later, and ad for SHAMPOO shows up. Fix the ads for the most part. 
See ya!"
US	4	2017-05-01	2.8.1	aitikka248	Thumbs up!	I love this game and enjoy it a lot. The problem is that when I switch between my pc and my phone it doesn't save.

US	3	2017-04-30	2.8.1	TrigNik	Wonderful fun!	I enjoy this game so much!  It is challenging enough to be fun but also not so hard to progress that it becomes frustrating!
US	5	2017-04-30	2.8.1	polarbear plays	Best thing for dragon lovers	This app is a lot of fun. You can have goals in the game. You can play and share with friends. The point is that it is something that you can play with people who are far away. You can help them out with the game but, it would be through the game.
US	5	2017-04-30	2.8.1	Lilani lani lilani lani	Addicting	This is fun and addicting, the dragons are cute

US	5	2017-04-29	2.8.1	Seabees123	Awesome game!!!	This game was awesome because u can play against others or a computer!!!Also,you can collect your own dragons and buy buildings!!🦄🦄🦄
US	5	2017-04-29	2.8.1	Cake dog 123	Better than dragon city	The models of the dragons are way better but there both pretty much the same game though but dml is also better because it's been out longer then dragon city :)

US	5	2017-04-28	2.8.1	in2sportsgurl	Love it but	I love my dragons! Wish I could get more of the good dragons but of course you have to spend money for that. And it's hard to get certain cards for your enhancement for your dragon. That needs work as well. But I've been playing for two years.

US	5	2017-04-26	2.8.1	Ess64	Can u please help...	I LOVE this game but I keep on having the same glitch. It's where I breed a dragon say... candy dragon and when it's ready to be hatched I open the egg and a go to find a habitat and it says I have too many habitats AND I DONT!!!
US	5	2017-04-26	2.8.1	CryMad	Liking it so far!!	No complaints yet!! Been playing for almost a year, still enjoying it. This is the longest I've ever played a game!
US	5	2017-04-26	2.8.1	Zenas momma	Great game	Love playing the game but wish things didn't take so long, breeding, hatching, food all seem to take extremely long for decent amounts or dragons which makes it hard to finish quests on time. Would love to be able to name the dragons myself also.

No cons so far, and this game is very fun, i recommend downloading it! I do not input real money into games and i don't plan to anytime soon, and it's good that this game only offers real money if you want extra stuff or special dragons. other than that, great game overall and you should download it!

US	5	2017-04-20	2.8.1	rvseattle	Love this game	I've been playing this game for a year now, and love it even more than I did when I started. You have to understand that you're in it for the long game – and that means that any particular battle or quest is just a means to an end. The fun is in the endlessly changing strategy and variety that are offered.
US	5	2017-04-20	2.8.1	Jbug22222	❤️dragons	Time building games are my favorite and this is a good one. I see slow of people saying you have to spend money for gems but I haven't had to yet. I'm enjoying it so far!!💕

US	4	2017-04-19	2.8.1	Pbroad2555	Enjoy Playing but NEEDS some things changed !	"This IS my FAVORITE GAME 
The diversity of Dragons is wonderful . 
  Enjoy the surprise of hatching new Dragons . 
   I DO GET AGGRAVATED when the game Levels up & refills your portal  -- It NEVER seems to happen when your portal is empty or almost empty . They need to make it where you can save the refill for when you need it. 
  Maybe have the saved refill expire in so many days or so. 
   I have quit trying for several of the events because of them giving you only a chance of receiving the award for whatever task it requires . I never get enough to complete those tasks to earn the big prizes. I am sure if I spent LOTS OF MONEY BUYING gems I could  earn the prizes . 
   Overall though THIS is my FAVORITE GAME"
US	4	2017-04-19	2.8.1	MeTonjaD	Pretty good	Just way to many ads on here
US	4	2017-04-19	2.8.1	Apostolicgirl:)	Great, but..	"I love this game, the baby dragons are adorable and I love taking care of all of them. My only problem is the annoying ads that will pop up right in the middle of me playing the game. I click a farm to collect food and right when I do, an ad pops up and then opens safari to pull up the website for the ad or whatever. It's super annoying. Also, video ads will play at random. I don't mind ads, as long as they're the kind that have an ""x"" at the top that I can close if I'm not interested..."
US	4	2017-04-19	2.8.1	Agarcia🖤	I loved it !!!!	I love this app and it is very addictive which is awesome . Also it's very simple with many help for u if u don't get it ! Which is unlikely. You can unlock many levels and the game goes on without ending !!!

US	3	2017-04-17	2.8.1	FoxiSlayer	please fix	i love the game a whole bunch!...But i think its unfair that you dont get alot of gems by doing things and you its really hard to breed certain dragons and costs WAY to much to buy them with gems. if this gets fixed then ill gladly give 5 stars cuz like i said i love this game!!!!
US	1	2017-04-17	2.8.1	Bandmaneiu	Trouble sharing account	My fiancé and i love this game. We like to play on the same account; she likes taking care of the dragons and I love battling. However she got annoyed with me using her android phone so I tried to put it on my iPad and connect to the same account. At first it was logging automatically into my Game Center which obviously wouldn't connect to her android. I logged out of Game Center and she connected her DML onto her Facebook. I reinstalled DML and logged in using her Facebook, still I'm at the beginning of the game and not on her account. We have tried to share the codes but it won't let us enter a code. This is a very simple thing that many of our other games do. Neither of us like DML enough to have our own separate accounts: she doesn't like the battle aspect and I don't care for keeping up with the Dragons. The help page is unhelpful. Will uninstall if something can't be fixed.

US	5	2017-04-16	2.8.1	Lord of Dragons	Best game of Dragons. 🐉🐲	If you love dragons, you'll love this game. But to enjoy the game you have to be smart and careful, it takes time and studying. But it's worth the hard work just like raising a real animal it's worth the hard work. This game can be very addictive but it's very fun. I have never enjoyed an app game like this one.
US	5	2017-04-16	2.8.1	Evelyn Caplinger	Pretty good overall	I've had this game for about 2 years and I still play all the time I'm really high level. But I still haven't got to upgrade my nest! It's so many diamonds! I think you should limit the amount of diamonds on this game and make it coin instead overall this game is amazing!
US	5	2017-04-16	2.8.1	YAY!!!!!EEK!!!SQUIGLE!!!!	LoVe!!!	This is an amazing game! It is kind of having a pet and it is also like placing things and u also get to go to war with them!!!! I recommend this app if u like what I have reported. Good game! Keep it up!!

US	4	2017-04-15	2.8.1	Yo Iz MAX	this game is 👍👌	"ive been playing this game for a while and it's pretty great. 
it's pretty easy to get gold, which is awesome. i see that a lot of people are complaining that it's rare to get gems in this game, but in all honesty i get a lot more gems in this game than i do in others similar to this. 
this isn't a game i play often though, because when i have time to kill im normally out of the house when i would have time to play, and i don't use cellular data. 
the only thing i dislike about this is how long it takes for dragons to breed. 
that's all i have to say about this game, i probably won't be updating my review. bye!!"

US	5	2017-04-14	2.8.1	VoxelDraqon	Dragons! :D	Dragons are my favorite animal, and this app allows me to have a million of them! There are some very expensive in app purchases, but they are easy to avoid it doesn't ever feel to me like I need them to play the game. One reservation I have about this game, though, is that I don't like keeping the dragons cooped up in tiny little habitats; I want them to be free!
US	5	2017-04-14	2.8.1	Brenda523900	Love this app	This app is so addictive and fun , i really like the special events but don't really have a lot of money to play with. I also wish you would leave the habitats open all the time, i have two eggs that i cannot place anywhere because I'm only on level 23 and I have to be on 26 before it will unlock. But all in all I love this app.

US	3	2017-04-13	2.8.1	rodrrj	Good, needs fixes	The game is great and addicting to play. It's interesting to mix and math the different types of dragons and see what happens. There are a few minor flaws. One of them being the gems. The game gives way to few gems to make any difference or any use of and if they are bought they should be bought in chunks which are expensive. The game also displays ads without warning which is HEAVILY annoying. You could b tapping the screen and it locks up for a bit and displays an ad which you unwillingly clicked already because you were tapping away at the screen.
US	4	2017-04-13	2.8.1	TokiOki	Fun game but time consuming	Fun game but I wish there was a quicker way to collect gold from individual dragons other than petting every single one of them three times.

Raising and training the dragons could be more  involved than just feeding them in order to level up, but battling is fun. It's hard to play without investing a lot of money in the game unless you are very patient.
US	4	2017-04-12	2.8.1	Brylle joseph	Good game	It's very addicting and a nice graphics
US	5	2017-04-12	2.8.1	Cibble gamer	So Much Better Than What I Expected!	When I got this game I thought it was going to be just like games like Dragon Vale, Dragon City etc. but this game has so many gameplay elements that are creative and fun! I 100% recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a new game to start playing!
US	1	2017-04-12	2.8.1	BoxingChildren66	Won't work	It keep on axing me for some tips of camaraderie so I don't like it .

US	5	2017-04-12	2.8.1	Heather Benford	Dragon Mania Legends.	Fun game. Incorporates a lot of strategy and planning. I really like the way the game let's you play at your own pace. I also like how you can earn other achievements while having assigned ones.
US	4	2017-04-11	2.8.1	Obsessed but having issues	Troubles with clan quest	I use this game religiously, but I am having trouble with the clan quests. I do the things it asks me to like collect food and use fury swipe, but they don't record in or give me the ingredients. Am I the only user having this issue? Is there any way I can fix it if it is me? Besides the issues with the clan quest, it's a very addicting game and I don't see myself getting tired of it any time soon

US	4	2017-04-11	2.8.1	Ashleyanna87	Fun	Got it for my daughter...I got addicted. You guys HAVE TO make it easier to get food and gems. Period.
US	4	2017-04-11	2.8.1	Never ever ever saying	Battles unfair	You get bumped into different categories after each contest (about every 3 days) and keeps putting up contenders that are hard category and 20 to 40 times stronger than your dragons and levels 40 levels above yours. Can only refresh with 5gems after first free refresh. BE fair and fix this problem!!!!
US	5	2017-04-10	2.8.1	MrsNoLeggz	Amazing game	I have been playing this game for a few months now and absolutely love it.
US	5	2017-04-10	2.8.1	B cscsthjjs😍🐴🐴🐴	Read Now.	"I love this game but I have ideas.  1. Get gems easier 2. You can chose which dragons to start with 3. To hatch dragons faster and to breed them faster 4. More types of dragons 5. Have more than two dragons in a habitat.

That is all I have to say. Have a good time playing the game."
US	5	2017-04-10	2.8.1	Killerelite721	Awesome	Me and my family love this game. We all play it. On iPad and phone I think all the dragons look cool.You get to battle and everything.

US	4	2017-04-10	2.8.1	McThizzle	Great game, could use a couple changes	I have been playing the game for months. Overall, it's a superb game. I really wish enchantment materials could be destroyed to make the weaker ones instead of only making stronger ones. Also, the islands should be able to support all level 6 habitats without having to plan exactly where everything goes. They just don't give enough space for all of your habitats.
US	5	2017-04-10	2.8.1	Emilyannfloyd	An actually really fun app!	The game is really cute and fun and I love all the different cute dragons! 10/10 would recommend

US	1	2017-04-10	2.8.1	Mr tba	It was a five star game!	What used to be an amazing five star game is being taken over by greed and to progress now requires real money to be spent.

US	5	2017-04-10	2.8.1	AmoureuxDeSang	Love it!!	Love it! Wish it was a way to get gems faster without spending money, but still love it! Been playing for years!
US	2	2017-04-10	2.8.1	aralei	Very addicting! BUT BEWARE...	"Very addicting, and the animations are decent quality but the gems are WAY too expensive and it's way too hard to earn enough of them to make a difference. SINCE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING COSTS GEMS THAT YOU HAVE TO BUY WITH REAL MONEY, ITS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING!

Eventually the over-expense of gems will stop me from playing the game.

UPDATE: 

WHAT A RIP-OFF!!!  I've just spent over $100 trying to get enough dragon food to win one of their prize dragons, (I really thought I had a chance of getting the prize dragon--stupid of me to think that) and because I cannot afford to spend any more real money it was a complete waste! They make their contests into money competitions with other players and it takes all the fun out of the game, especially when you get to the higher levels and everything costs more. 

All I get as a prize for spending all my money is literally $2 worth of virtual stuff in the game.

At least give the other participants prizes that are worth what they spent in the competition!!!

I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! :("

US	3	2017-04-09	2.8.1	BenderLover🍺	Good but there are some gaps	This game sounded fun there where some things you needed jems for but I didn't mind. However the farther I got and the more   Coins I got I realized how rare it is to get jems. It's a gimmick to get your money. There are rarely times when you can get jems and I ended up with 2.95 million gold and 340 jems. Not only that but adds explode on my screen. Constantly when I'm feeding my dragon, and when I'm getting a reward. You can also watch videos to have a chance to get jems. This is basically like gambling, most of the time you get gold or food or whatever. And last the higher level dragon the more food you have to get. I do have positive things, the dragons have great traffics and have different movements and sounds they make. Still needs more more work but overall good.

US	2	2017-04-08	2.8.1	TiaAddict	Otto'sLotto	I thought I clicked on the Otto's Lotto that I would get more gems by like watching a video or something. And yes it is a video, but it a wheel with like the two smallest sections for gems. It's click for gems not click for a slight chance to collect gems. In other games it's watch a video or sign up for this, ect. I think you guys should do that instead. Sometimes people don't have the money yo keep buying gems or even the luck to win. That's pretty much all I don't like about the game.
US	5	2017-04-08	2.8.1	Ms201406	Drakons	Gut!!!
US	3	2017-04-08	2.8.1	GilgameshINC	Could be 5 stars	I understand why we have ads but this is just too much
US	5	2017-04-08	2.8.1	Weebalo19536953	Best Game on the App Store	I highly recommend this game, as all of the dragons are really well made, and look really cool.  It also has a built-in feature where you can record the screen, and record your voice.
US	3	2017-04-08	2.8.1	Rodey17	Great game	This is a great time killer game and especially if you like dragons but there's way to many ads. It's like every 2 minutes another ad pops up randomly. It would definitely be understandable if there ads every 20-30 minutes or something like that but not 1-2 minutes apart. Until then, this game is fun and will stay at 3 stars until the ads are changed.

US	5	2017-04-08	2.8.1	Arkoness	Fun game	I enjoy this game kind of reminds me of dragon vale. You can battle,breed,upgrade,build skill lvl and win dragons in competitions . Do have to spend money to play but can buy lower amounts still build.
US	4	2017-04-08	2.8.1	Alurajean	Addicting	Love. It.   Some times the video glitches are a pain.  I like to breed the different dragons.  I like how enchanted breeding gives you dragons to use for your best chances.  The most frustrating sometimes are the events and trying to get the special dragons.
US	5	2017-04-08	2.8.1	darkclaw102	Awesome!!!!!!!!!	I love it!! It's my favorite game ever!! I suggest it to all of my fellow dragon lovers out there, and anyone else who wants a awesome game.

US	5	2017-04-08	2.8.1	Dallasprod34	Great game but	Way too many pop up ads
US	4	2017-04-08	2.8.1	Creashana	Good but needs work.	I love this game. But, it takes a lot of data so it limits my playing.  Also the really cool or helpful things (such as upgrading the nest) only takes large amounts of gems which are almost impossible to earn that amount. Also making things take 2 million gold is ridiculous while trying to pay for crops to upgrade your dragons and scrolls are scarce to upgrade your dragons. I have made a couple purchases but it seems impossible to level up multiple dragons. I love the game, especially since the pop up ads have been taken out. I just feel sad seeing stuff that I won't be able to reach for months.
US	4	2017-04-08	2.8.1	girls x4	Good Game	I am enjoying this game. Probably my favorite right now.  If I play for a short time everything is fine. But trying to keep my higher rated dragons fed let alone feed all my dragons is pretty difficult. It would be easier if the coins were used for food instead of gems.   Mating and hatching time can also be a drag so I just leave the game for a while and let everything catch up. Four stars is the highest I have ever rated a game so keep updating and I will keep playing.
US	5	2017-04-08	2.8.1	Pt0616	Endless	Love love love, there is endless and keep coming out new dragons. Really , how many different kind there has. Just one thing, if less food to feed the dragon will be best. Thanks for the fun game. MUST TRY!!!!!!!

US	4	2017-04-07	2.8.1	Bettybeartrap	Started out fun. But getting pricey to play	When I first started playing it was fun to get the dragons and build up lands. Now everything is getting expensive to purchase in the game - you need to spend actual money to help upgrade the lands and dragons.  Also there are glitches in getting card pieces to win dragons.
US	5	2017-04-07	2.8.1	LuvRugby	Dragons galore!	Good time with lots of adorable dragons!

US	5	2017-04-07	2.8.1	ThatOneWeaboo	Awesome!	If you liked DragonVale, this is the game for you. Similar to said game, it is more intractable and allows you to do more with your dragons.
US	5	2017-04-07	2.8.1	Candie46	Too Expensive	I like the game but every thing is expensive,the dragons,habitats,food,training even to level up. It's ridiculous. I give it one star.2/24/17,like I said before the game is good but everything is expensive,to buy the dragons with diamonds are too expensive, to expand, to clear the island,and I can't get friends. My husband and my son plays the game but there not my friends. They have Facebook and their still not my friends. I need help. Can you please help me and low down the prices. I'm still playing the game I like it but still my husband and my son are not my friends.4/6/17.

It's a very good game and I hope if your reading this that you'll install it. It's highly  recommend that you will like it too and think the same about it
US	1	2017-04-07	2.8.1	Meluvyoulongtime	Game is fun but......	There are way too many pop up ads!  So many that they just pop up while you're trying to do stuff and wind up clicking on the ad and get taken out the game completely. In my opinion there shouldn't be pop up ads since you watch so many ads just to get coins and other things
US	5	2017-04-07	2.8.1	Nintendo Gamer 51	Absolutely Great	I have played this game on Android, and got all the way to the shadow elements and just bought the volcanic island, but I had to restart because I got an iPhone, but that doesn't stop me, I loved and still love this game with the prize ranks, the adorable baby dragons, the battles, the cool little animations that few of the dragons have, and all the islands! This game always cheered me up. I still need to ask my friend to play it again, he might not though, the bosses always made him rage.😂😂 You can make friends on this game in clans too! I just love it. I think that's about all I can say, hope this game gets more!! Hopefully I can get back to where I was too.😅
US	5	2017-04-07	2.8.1	MeLikey33	I like it a lot!	DML is awesome, but the only thing I don't like is the pop up ads. The rpg battles and breeding is a lot of fun! Keep it up game Loft!

US	4	2017-04-07	2.8.1	Belladinna 113	Dragon Mania  Definately	Good game, very entertaining and fun. Problem I find its just very difficult to get food to feed your dragons so they can level up. Egg breeding and hatching also very long wait, but if you have the time, you won't really mind. It is very discouraging though that unless you are at a very high level in the game and have a lot of ways to get food and coins, you will never be able to get the awesome adorable dragons for the gold and food gathering events ,as well as the feeding events. This to me, is very disheartening.

US	3	2017-04-06	2.8.1	stampgirl58	Like the BUT!!!!!!!!!!!	I really do like the game, and I don't mind working for gems BUT COST OF THINGS IN THIS GAME Is ridiculous.. I play another very popular dragon game and the cost of dragons and other things in the game like hatching is not as ridiculous. Also you were able to give Gems as gifts to your friends. In Dragon Mania one of the ways is on the wheel which by the way he never gives gems. So for a game that is supposed to relax you and give you a little fun just cost you a lot of money so buyer beware!!!😬

US	5	2017-04-06	2.8.1	Jo 1973	Fun!	Enjoy the game!
US	5	2017-04-06	2.8.1	Unknownuser5551	Meh	I guess it's okay...

US	5	2017-04-06	2.8.1	Jake0swag	Dragon mania	Good game
US	5	2017-04-06	2.8.1	Searn💘	AWESOME	This game is awesome! You can play with your dragons and throw food to them to feed them. It's so much fun! Battling is easy to learn, but requires strategy and skill. I would recommend this game to anybody who wants their own pet dragons.
US	2	2017-04-06	2.8.1	CariAnne24	LOT OF ADS!	Fun game but every few minutes there is a pop up ad either video or screen shot. Super annoying!! Would be a great game otherwise.
US	4	2017-04-06	2.8.1	Lizziekinz	Like it.	I like the game, but it's a patience and time game if u don't spend money on gems and such
US	5	2017-04-06	2.8.1	Keithc58	Dragon Mania Legends	Great game, makes you think.
US	5	2017-04-06	2.8.1	Profabi	Dragon mania legends	Fun and also tricky. Missions and challenges sometimes require a player level way higher than the current one which can be frustrating...
US	3	2017-04-06	2.8.1	aaronthenanny	Ads galore	"Ads keep crashing to a Dreamscapes pic requiring restart.
Mystery gifts are a terrible idea, let us give our friends what they need!
For low level players the ads are obnoxious click bait pop overs that slow the game and don't close properly rather they click thru to the browser for more ad dollars"

US	5	2017-04-06	2.8.1	CayCay0823	Very fun	This is a really cool game, and it's not like other dragon games. It has a lot more stuff to do, besides just building the game up.

US	5	2017-04-06	2.8.1	Pokemon/Dragon trainer	Awesome Game	I love the graphics of this game and its battles. I also like how there are different dragons to collect and battle, and I think Gameloft has really brought out its point of view and creativity on what dragons can really be and look. This game is my absolute favorite and Gameloft really has done a great job on this game, and everything about it 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😍😍😍
US	5	2017-04-06	2.8.1	Penguinking2424	Lovely	The game is constantly putting out special little events, really brings the competitive side, very fun and addictive. I highly recommend this game to all.

US	3	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Chelios09	Great game but the devs aren't.	The game it self is amazing. A few glitches that the devs can't seem to figure out with claiming free prizes though. When you email the devs and explain your problem they seem like they don't care. That's really my only complaint about the game.
US	5	2017-04-05	2.8.0	EragonDragon4life	Thanks guys!	Thank you guys for the awesome game you have built I am having such a good time with it! My entire family plays the game anyways thank you again 🙂👍🏻

US	3	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Mwolford	Great but now not so much	The game itself is great. The pop up ads are becoming very annoying and especially when you are right in the middle of something and you have to restart what you were doing. Now after this last update I have been having a lot of trouble where all my dragons are just dark shapes. The game seems to be freezing more too.
US	5	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Spellbinder1985	Great game	Game play is great fun, engaging and creative. The dragons are adorable.
US	1	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Mr. B's	Way to many ads	Its seems no one really makes anything for free! All just make apps. Now to make money off kids. Its not the marketing but the type of ads in the game that just pop up, like spam or a virus. Be careful out there!!
US	4	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Psygeek	Fun game	Fun and addictive, though slow to play without spending real money.
US	5	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Fnaf😋	Amazing	I have his game for Microsoft and I LOVE it. When I got the email and saw it was for Apple I immediately had to come here. The game is very well made and the number of ads are reasonable...Other than that nothing wrong with the game.
US	4	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Melove09	Love	The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars is cause the app won't link to my Facebook :/ and super sad I can't get the dragon that you get when you like to Facebook :/ other then that I love this game so much fun....I also heard about this game through my one of YouTube people.
US	5	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Kai😄	Can't stop	When I first started playing it I was instantly addicted to this game.

US	5	2017-04-05	2.8.0	NelA0502	Super Fun Game	"Super fun! My husband, brother in law and sister in law and myself all play. We ""play together"" telling each either the dragons we just got or the ones we want and how excited we are to have/get those dragons."
US	5	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Tlb4327	Fun game	Cute dragons. Fun no pressure timeline, with fun mini event games constantly running.  I just wish I could make 'friends' outside of FB to play these games with.
US	5	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Regina0366	Love it	Check in at least twice a day so far and really enjoying it

US	4	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Linzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz	Good game but too many adds	The game is well thought out and fun, but the game stops randomly every five minutes for a pop up add.
US	1	2017-04-05	2.8.0	MEasterday	If only the crashes would stop!!!	Since the last update my game immediately crashes after opening it every time... I really Love this game- but now I can't even play

US	4	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Diamondz_xo	Great Game!	I love this game! Its so addicting! Only issue is that it pressures people to use money in order to win competitions, etc.
US	5	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Sweetjimmyphats	Brilliant...which makes ya think	This game is all but perfect, it has taken me for $75 dollars. More then a new play station game. But if you want that edge, if you want to succeed, sooner or later you pay. For example, your nursery, just to make room for more then one egg. Your gonna have to PAY. HOWEVER, it's the best game. Love it. Hooked. I play it with my son, everyday
US	5	2017-04-05	2.8.0	Julianna Kassenbrock	LOVE!	This game is super fun (and addicting) and very well done. I really enjoy the music too! The only annoying thing is clicking on the ads that pop up randomly, but otherwise it's great!
US	5	2017-04-04	2.8.0	Bruhbruh urh	:)	Cool game
US	3	2017-04-04	2.8.0	ERinSPI	Graphics nice, but ads distracting	My daughter loves this game.  The graphics are nice, the dragons look cool, it has some great features.  However, the ads are distracting.  They come on quite often, you get redirected to a browser, then the app has to reload again. I also have a problem where it loses my connection, sometimes several times in the space of five minutes, then the app has to reload again. The reload takes 30-40 seconds, so it is pretty irritating.

US	5	2017-04-03	2.7.0	😍Audrey😍	Great quality	I like all the dragons in this game. How you get to raise them, and train them, and but them into battle to get more points!
US	5	2017-04-03	2.7.0	Cleaning the car	It's awesome....But...	I love it it's really cool I just hate that at the beginning you don't have that much gems to get cool dragons but when you earn more gems then you can get cool dragons

US	4	2017-03-31	2.7.0	Mimz0126	Used to be fun	"I used to enjoy this game...
Mindless entertainment, great graphics and after figuring out how to get rid of the ads:
 (just purchase something for .99 cents)
 had a lot of fun. 
Probably spent way more time than I should be spending on a game. 
So...
There have been a couple of ""upgrades"" and yuck!!!
The first was some kind of enchantment place. Boring and takes too long to do anything. Can't even control your dragons during battles.
 Dumb!
The latest ""upgrade""..
I don't even know where to start. 
Clan quests:
You can only do one at a time.
What???!!
It's going to take forever to get puzzle pieces for special dragons unless, of course, you spend real cash or hard earned gems. Dumber!!
No more personal quests. 
That makes me sad : (
 I liked having a little ""me"" time! Lol
And there are things our clan hasn't been able to figure out.
Dumbest !!!
It doesn't make sense anymore. 
I have found I'm spending a lot less time on it which I suppose is a good thing but I used to really enjoy playing and now it's not fun. 
Told my clan members I may not be on as much...
What a bummer..."
US	5	2017-03-31	2.7.0	NARWALLS RULE	Good game but...	It's good but do u think u could make it so we can play without internet cause I am going on a trip and I want to play it but I can't I could but I would be using LTE ugh just can u plz do it plz

US	3	2017-03-30	2.7.0	KB203924	CURSE YOU ADS	Good but the ads ruin the good experience
US	5	2017-03-30	2.7.0	Fifu4378654	Awesome	Este juego me pone bn bellako
US	3	2017-03-30	2.7.0	Tina1413	Love it but..	Way to many advertisements. My game freezes up because it is constantly trying to load an ad. It's gotten to the point I have considered deleting the game. If there was less ads I'd say this is a pretty awesome game.
US	4	2017-03-30	2.7.0	Star_ship_flying_high_123	Good	Good game. Yet I think there should be more ways to get some gems
US	1	2017-03-29	2.7.0	Beachchick24	Pay To Play RipOff game 👎🏽	Don't wast your time AND money downloading this game. Gameloft has ruined this game by changing the format and charging you for absolutely EVERYTHING just to play. Outrageous!!!
US	5	2017-03-28	2.7.0	Mystery31	Love this game	This game is great. I love all the dragons and all the challenges
US	5	2017-03-28	2.7.0	Amazing stories	I love dragon games	Therefore, I love this game.
US	4	2017-03-28	2.7.0	"""forever""home"	Pretty great!	"I agree with the rest of you guys about the insane number of ads, but the most annoying part is that lately, every single ad has been for the exact same thing! I'm tired of seeing the same ad over and over. Also, the wait times, I really don't mind. I actually like how it's so expensive to speed them up - I think of it as a way to tell myself ""no, it's not worth it spending 15 gems instead of just waiting 5 more minutes."" Dragon designs are cool, love the kinda 3D look, and one last thing. Two. Why are the new islands SO EXPENSIVE??? I mean the swamp wasn't that much and then I look at the desert and it says to unlock 2.5 million coins! Also, what would be cool is if you could have a super rare chance to actually breed boss dragons! It would make them a bit easier to get. But only major problem is PLEASE LESS POP UP ADS!!!!"
US	1	2017-03-28	2.7.0	Tara Ember Williams	App Store	Dragon Mania Legends used to be such a fun game but now has become a complete rip off, all they want is money to complete any activity, save your time and play something else instead!
US	5	2017-03-28	2.7.0	rexygeo	Ya	Pretty good game
US	5	2017-03-27	2.7.0	Hxhdjejf	Fun	I play it when I'm bored
US	5	2017-03-27	2.7.0	Cutieamazing	Awesome	I really like this game it's so cool and like how building stuff sometimes takes seconds and not minutes or hours
US	5	2017-03-27	2.7.0	Giraffegirl05	Loving it	Love love love love it!!!!!
US	1	2017-03-27	2.7.0	golVmoT	Copy	It's a copy of dragon city
US	3	2017-03-27	2.7.0	Calodi	Too expensive	Too many ads need more options to go ad free that doesn't cost every week or cost a ton in real money, everything is too expensive, needs an option to put eggs from breeding to storage, literally can't get anywhere in the game because of cost, also it's impossible to get anywhere in the contests unless you have money to waste because of the way everything is structured. The way the events are structured is biased and will only work if you pay real money but even then I'm not sure how anyone wins because if you aren't on the game every five minutes collecting gold, food or whatever the task then you go down a tier why, (once we go up a tier) don't we just stay there instead of going down in rank and just gradually move up? For example the first tier collect 1-1000food/gold second tier collect 1001-2000 third tier collect 2001-3000 etc. it doesn't have to be easy just at least more goal oriented where you not be knocked back down if you aren't on it every 5 minutes collecting you just stay on that tier. I would be more than willing to put a little money into a game that I get more value for what I'm spending in fact I have done so with other apps but this app everything costs so much for what you buy be it gems etc then it costs too much in the game to spend those gems on anything. Please dragon mania listen to your customers suggestions or check out how buying in other games works I can buy 4 to 5 times as many items in other games for the same price of 20 gems in this game
US	3	2017-03-26	2.7.0	YogiBearCast	Won't Connect	Tried connecting to Facebook but it never connects and I have to force close the app in order to play again. Please fix this.
US	5	2017-03-26	2.7.0	Bloodtooth67	The best way to pass time	I stared blankly in the game and played so long I didn't know the time was 3hours passed on from me first entering the game

US	4	2017-03-26	2.7.0	TheKatBoss	One problem	So I love this game except for one thing all of my habitats say that I've built the maximum amount of them which is 14 but the maximum amount of one habitat I've built is 3 I find this very annoying since I haven't even unlock half of the habitats and it still says I've built 14 of them please fix this glitch
US	5	2017-03-26	2.7.0	Zanderkaboose	Echoes of Dragonvale	I love it so far.  Reminds me of Dragonbale, plus battles.  Where is bad?

US	2	2017-03-22	2.7.0	FastClawz	Pay To Play	"I love this game a lot! I've been playing for about two years. The graphics are clean and very pretty. The dragon designs are also really cool! However I think I speak for everyone when I say the gem speed up prices for hatching eggs or building stuff are WAY to high. That really is the only problem I have. It seems kinda scam-y to have to pay to get rid of ads AND to speed up things around your island. 
Also, if you don't pay, there are SO many ads that the game is UNPLAYABLE. You can't give people the option to watch ads and have pop ups. It's one or the other!"

US	3	2017-03-19	2.7.0	Moon Dragon101	Love it,but it Glitches A lot	I love the game and the dragon types and all,but sometimes the game glitches and some of my dragons and habitats turn gray with red question marks on them,and when I click on those,it says that I have to download it first.I usually don't mind,but It's eating up my storage space and my data.I'm thinking about deleting it.

US	5	2017-03-19	2.7.0	Devin🤤🤤🤤0113	Best game ever	This is the best game I have ever played.  At first monster legends was until the commercial for dragon mania legends came on the tv.
US	3	2017-03-19	2.7.0	Eggless him crumbly	Too many ads and too much wait time	I like the game overall, except there are WAY too many ads. It's kind of ridiculous. Another thing that is ridiculous is the wait time. When I first started a few days ago, the second dragon I was hatching took 2 hours to hatch. That is super dumb, because I know that the hatching time will just keep going up. Also, things in this game are way to expensive. How do you expect the low leveled people that play this game to get anything done with a very limited amount of money. Please make things less expensive, take time off of everything, and get rid of the ads so I can give this 5 stars.
US	5	2017-03-19	2.7.0	Dsbeek	Great game	Fun, addictive game
US	5	2017-03-19	2.7.0	Lolray7	Great	Amazing game
US	1	2017-03-18	2.7.0	Chicken nugget thief	It's alright	Used to play this game a long time ago(like years ago) and I'd almost rather play it the way it was. It was simple but at least I wasn't getting ads thrown in my face every 5 minutes. Not to mention the screen have like 3 spots on it that take up a good portion of the bottom half trying to get me to buy dragons and money and stuff. Just not worth it to me to play it if it's nothing but trying to force me to spend $$$ by throwing it right there in the way of the actual game. Not good placement.
US	1	2017-03-18	2.7.0	YuuKamuy	COULD be good, but...	Cute graphics and fairly easy UI, BUT ads completely ruin this game. You cannot go more than a minute or two without an add popping up. Even the ones you can click the X out of tend to pop up as you're clicking on something else so it registers that you hit the add. It also tends to crash at the end of a battle so it registers your loss of energy but gives you no credit for the win. Waste of data, would not recommend.
US	5	2017-03-18	2.7.0	StrechMeowKitty	Amazing!	I love this game so much, it runs smoothly, is very fun, and the dragons are Adorable! This game is kind of addicting.
US	3	2017-03-18	2.7.0	BeccaBlue96	Really like this game however....	So I am really enjoying this game, I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for wait time being really long. It's really hard to get gems without using real money and I just can't afford that. It would be nice if there were a small one time fee to be a VIP, or if you just hit a certain level to be a VIP, again not everyone can afford to keep paying real money for things. This is a fun game, it's got a lot of great dragons and the graphics are really good too. Make things more affordable and I'll give you 5 stars!!!!

US	1	2017-03-12	2.7.0	Emilyraccoon	Ad's ruin the game.	I never have before had a game that has so many pop up ads I can not play for more than five minutes without ads popping up, sometimes three can pop up within less than two minutes sometimes I play and am fine, I have lost 1400 coins do two ads popping up in the middle of training my dragons, I can be in the same room as the Internet box and the icon that shows your Internet status bar pops up and kicks me off making me restart I've had this happen in the middle of training, collecting coins, farming fruitor doing the daily battle challenges, all this ad popping up as made the game beyond impossible  playing and infuriating. Far as I'm concerned this game can go take a flying leap after trying to complain and 4  back and forth email attempts to retrieve back my lost coins due to add pop ups when I'm trying to train my dragons and losing 1400 coins I'm  done trying to get my coins back and playing when I got a email saying ads where part of the games,and to send proof of when of date I lost coins which I sent twice. Don't play  this game  they steal ur coins and add pop up are the worse u have seen in any game ever

US	4	2017-03-06	2.7.0	KingCeasarCat	Names	I LOVE this game and find it quite addicting but was disappointed when my male dragon's name was Moana! Even before seeing the movie, I would say that is a girls name! Then I was let down about my wind dragon who was named Clay. I know clay is a real name but I would choose different for a GIRL!!!! But, this game is fun and addicting and should be updated so you can name your dragon what you want!!! Also, nobody likes it when you give them 16 gems and make them use 5 in their tutorial!!!! You could have gotten 5 stars if you fixed your flaws!
US	5	2017-03-05	2.7.0	Animeren	So far	"So far so good. I usually delete these games fairly quickly as they come to expect too much time. Always waiting for food and what not. Will know better in a couple weeks if it's worth the time. Update...still playing. It takes a while to build up dragons having to wait on enough food and the constant ad interruptions are a drag. That said, there are a lot of quests to keep it interesting and the dragons are adorable. I'm going to give it some more time. Update... I spent $10 on a package special and I no longer have ads interrupting my game so that is a definite plus. The downside is I spent $10. I usually don't spend money on games as a rule but I genuinely like this game. It's the first of its kind I have played longer than a month. That said, there have been some issues since the last update. The game loses the connection frequently and if you are in the middle of a battle you lose your token. I'm hoping they are working on a fix for this. I'd hate to see it deleted from my phone after investing so much time. Again, the dragons are adorable. I will give it another couple weeks...Update...still playing after 6 months. That is a really long time for me. I enjoy the game and the cute dragons which have character and you can interact with them. That said I am disappointed in some of the challenges. It seems like the game sets you up to fail. This past Halloween challenge, for instance, offered several new, very adorable dragons but trying to complete the challenge in a timely manner was nearly impossible. We were given 7 days, which would seem sufficient, however, you had to wait for several hours in between resets. I have determined you cannot win the prizes without spending real money. I get it. The designers/makers of the game need to make money to both continue updating content & also put cash in their pockets. They have to earn a living after all. But! This game is EXPENSIVE! I admit to throwing in a few bucks here and there but I have to say what you get is really not worth it. I'm finding that if I don't have time to finish the challenge and win the dragon then I just won't play them. Now. The main reason I play this game is to collect the dragons. If it gets to a point where I no longer get any new dragons then I will definitely quit. For now, I will continue to play and provide updates when they ask me to. Until next time...Update: been nearly a year now and still playing. Again my biggest issue is they do not give you enough time to complete a mission and collect certain new dragons. To obtain them you would have to spend real money. Here is one example of what you might get if you were to spend around $10, 250,000 food, 200,000 gold and a dragon that is easy to get on your own, in fact you probably already have it. I have been playing for a year now and the highest level I have reached with any dragon is level 30. It takes a lot of food and 250,000 is a measly sum. You can easily get 200,000 gold on your own through your habitats- I get a few million gold Everytime I collect from habitats. So my point is, don't spend real money for basically no reason. It's a little frustrating to see a new dragon you could ""win"" by completing a mission, when there is no time to complete it without spending cash to increase the speed of hatching, mating, etc.  I do play the missions because you do get prizes at different intervals over several days but I have resigned myself with the knowledge I will never complete them. As I have said previously, the dragons are cute and interactive. Some are downright hilarious in their actions, each with a personality. The battles are a breeze once you reach a higher level and you can always recruit help from other players for a particularly tough boss. Have fun!"

US	5	2017-03-02	2.7.0	UncleJemima53	Very fun! Add me!	This game is excellent! My son pointed it out and we have been playing it for about a week now. If you're interested you can add me! Code 758855.

US	5	2017-03-02	2.7.0	💕🎀Jocie🎀💕	Awesome 👏	This game has great quality and doesn't lag like all the others. My only problem with it is it tries to sell you stuff every 2 minutes.
US	5	2017-03-02	2.7.0	Just love it.	Love it	11/10 do again
US	5	2017-03-02	2.7.0	Elizabeth Shine	Great 👍🏻 App!	I ❤ the awesome and creative dragons ! Little laggy and glitchy at times but..I RECOMMEND IT! Some items are too expensive but those are the only bad things about it.Only 10% of the game is bad to me!The other 90% is a awesome fantasy game that has great creativity!
US	5	2017-03-02	2.7.0	Aniyah Faulkner	Love It	I love this game its very addictive.. and it can be time taking but it helps out when bored .... or even if u just want someone to do ..... you should definitely|| install>open>and play
US	5	2017-03-02	2.7.0	Fitpath	Me	I am very happy with Dragon mania, it is now the only game I play.  I am especially pleased with the enhancement on the enchanted league. I had given up working with it in the beginning. I Think that the potions was a great addition and makes it more usable
US	5	2017-03-02	2.7.0	Jaydominick01	Great game	Best game in the world have to get it
US	5	2017-03-01	2.7.0	Gpooofgggjfj	Fun	Great game
US	5	2017-03-01	2.7.0	Iron dragon 1313	Love it	Love this game, love all the dragons, love collecting them all!!!!!!!!
US	4	2017-03-01	2.7.0	AuntieDebrocks	Love the graphics	But I'm not overly fond of how much money I've ended up spending since I cannot log on every 2 hours to collect my dragons gold which in turn feeds my dragons which in turn, you get my drift.
US	5	2017-03-01	2.7.0	Sasunaru0091	Great	I really like this game a lot. I though it would be boring when I first downloaded it and started to play, but it's actually really fun. It cool seeing all the different dragons you can get and being able to see what it looks like as a baby and an adult. Great game
US	5	2017-03-01	2.7.0	KipWest	Love it!	This game I love!
US	5	2017-03-01	2.7.0	Robmary626	DML	Great game!  Very addictive
US	4	2017-03-01	2.7.0	Zygarde19	A good game	The game is well built but the obstacles take way too long and the quest keep popping up every second
US	4	2017-03-01	2.7.0	NelsonAngel	Love this game... one problem though.	So I play this game all the time and I absolutely love it! The problems I have with the game currently is the wait times.. it took me a whole day just to hatch my Agent Dragon.. that's a little ridiculous and I know the timers will go up from there. I also wish we got XP easier. The more you level up it gets very hard to get XP. There's also a bug right now when I go to watch a video for a card pack it doesn't work??? Please fix this.
US	5	2017-03-01	2.7.0	jme_x333	BUGS !!!	Every since I updated my game my dragons have been floating question marks, I'm unable to battle breed or hatch any of my eggs that are complete. Anyone else having this problem ??? When I try to do anything on the game it says download a thing that takes up 0.0 MB of space. But says I have no storage and I do ??
US	5	2017-02-28	2.7.0	Ddrrybbc	Love it	My 5 year loves it!!!

US	5	2017-02-28	2.7.0	Lady_of_lake2000	DragonML	My 5 year old wanted to play this game, so I put it on his iPad and at some point it ended up on my phone so I play it with him. Love the game! Wish there were more farms and better help when trying to find out how things are played.
US	5	2017-02-28	2.7.0	Howard The Bomb	What I think	It's deff a fun game and it has great detail. Also it's easy to learn as I go. Very interesting
US	5	2017-02-28	2.7.0	Cerridwenscall	❤️ Dragonlandia👍👍	A great game for a short life escape with loads of sweet looking dragons!! Easy, free to inexpensive to play...all depends on your gaming style, and your patience, lol. Play 1 time a day or so for all features & check in to collect gold & treasure up to every 2 hrs to maximize gold! A+ game
US	5	2017-02-28	2.7.0	The Imani Code	Wowza	Great game! Lots of fun for all ages!
US	5	2017-02-28	2.7.0	Heyitsheather	Fun game.	More complex than other similar games.
US	1	2017-02-28	2.7.0	Kimmmyttt	Bugs?	I can't seem to fix the bugs, it's telling me to download extra parts in the game and I try. Says I need more space in my phone but I have so much memory!!
US	5	2017-02-28	2.7.0	Dani3193	Game	Best game ever love it
US	5	2017-02-28	2.7.0	Annoyed with your product	Has something for everyone!	The game works well and when it doesn't they fix it quick. They have a life something in the game for everyone: teamwork with friends, clans, turn based fighting, other variations of battling other than the initial turn based battling, and my favorite part -- the breeding and building up your islands.
US	5	2017-02-28	2.7.0	Gusserpoo	Dragon mania legends	I love this game you breed dragons and get a different dragons you battle different peoples dragons and win prizes like other dragons you feed them and you can inchant your dragons ween you get three dragons at a level 16
US	4	2017-02-28	2.7.0	Starbucks forever☕️	Great game but just a few things to fix	I really enjoy this game except it can be very slow, and adds pop up every 5 seconds! I cant play the game without accidentally tapping a add and it taking me to safari. Other than that, this game is great and addicting!

US	5	2017-02-27	2.7.0	me2orion	Love the game, but…	The game is great and I love getting all the different dragons. It always is a challenge trying to breed the ones you want. Pop ups were a problem a few months ago, but gotten much better. Some of the newest changes I'm not so sure if they are all that great or not. But we can't have everything. Overall, I love the game. ❤❤❤
US	5	2017-02-27	2.7.0	Karissa elledge	Dragons	Love this game you should definitely get it!!!!!🤗🤗

US	5	2017-02-27	2.7.0	Huhs1982	Best addiction!!	Love this game!! Everyone I tell about it gets hooked!
US	4	2017-02-27	2.7.0	Goltggdtkgcf	Weird bug	Fun game, but about once a week it will have a weird bug where some of the dragons data doesn't load in and you can't accomplish anything if one of the affected dragons are involved. Sometimes it fixes itself, or I download the missing data with the prompts provided. But it happens to regularly for it to be a occasional thing. I think they should work it out before they think of adding any new dragons to the game.
US	5	2017-02-27	2.7.0	Workpark	Workpark	I've had a lot of fun playing this game. I was referred to it after Tinyco stopped supporting all their games, especially Tiny Monsters. This is much better! It's definitely not just for kids. I've referred many people to this, it's pretty addictive.
US	5	2017-02-27	2.7.0	Joshjoshjjjjjjjjj	Dragons	Awsome
US	5	2017-02-27	2.7.0	Wyldaboutfun	Fun	It's entertaining.  I've already spent $2.  I NEVER spend money in games anymore.  But I think it was worth it.
US	5	2017-02-26	2.7.0	Radiojenna	One of the best games I've ever played.	I love the game and the dragons. My favorite dragon is my bee dragon named Dona at level 10. I am at level 13. I have 4 level 10 dragons.
US	5	2017-02-26	2.7.0	jay560	Awesome game	I enjoy this game.

US	5	2017-02-26	2.7.0	912Raised	Asf	Fun
US	3	2017-02-26	2.7.0	flamethrower1987	Ad pop ups are horrible	Would be a lot better if ads didn't constantly pop up out of nowhere when you're clicking the screen and then your phone is over run with crap!!
US	4	2017-02-26	2.7.0	RageWolf16	Pretty much what I expected	Gems are hard to come by and definitely worth a lot, so this is a game that makes you work for progress. The graphics and art are way better than I thought they'd be, and the style is continuous throughout the game, which is always good. I like to have a recognizable aesthetic. The premise and plot aren't great, but none of these world cultivating games have super complex plots. I LOVE that you can breed dragons, and especially that none of them have sexes, so you can breed any two. It makes things very simple in that regard. Overall great game!
US	5	2017-02-26	2.7.0	THE BEST220	Loveit	"LOVE IT SO MUCH ;)
I love this game so much and my friends and family loves it to"
US	5	2017-02-26	2.7.0	Addlish	Best game ever	It is very different from other games where you have to wait years tho something stupid like battling your dragons
US	5	2017-02-26	2.7.0	Chiefsaggyballs	Great game	Been playing for about a year and half now and absolutely love it
US	3	2017-02-26	2.7.0	Mommieofthrer	Cute.... but hard to advance	This is a cute game. The dragons are cute and it's fun to play, however, it's very hard to advance. In the beginning it's super easy, of course. But the farther you get the harder it gets. The events are almost impossible to play and actually achieve anything. It feels like you're constantly in your game and it still doesn't make a difference. It's impossible to earn enough gems to buy anything with them! I mean when things cost 3000 plus gems, the only way you're getting anything with them is to buy some with real money. It's not too difficult to earn gold coins but everything costs a ridiculous amount! Still, with patience, you can buy stuff with the coins. Just not the gems. The other thing is, it's SUPER HARD to level up your dragons once you get past level 10 and it's very hard to grow enough food to level them up. I do the multi farm function and the most food you can get at one time is 7500 which sounds like a lot when you have 13 farms, but it cost 2.4 million coins to grow that and to level up my dragons I fight with, it costs over 20,000 food EACH TIME! And it takes 4 feeds to level up to the next level. It's insane! I'll have accumulated 150,000 food and can barely do anything with that!  I have also actually spent money on this game and I still wasn't able to really achieve anything. I know they need money to make advancements and such, but it shouldn't be impossible! I don't have real money to keep spending on stupid games. Good for all the rich people out there who can! Most of us aren't in that category, though! I'll keep playing it, but I'm on the verge of deleting it. It takes up way too much time to not be able to do anything.
US	5	2017-02-26	2.7.0	Taco.Cat_ftw	So much Fun	The graphics look amazing and the game is a lot of fun
US	4	2017-02-26	2.7.0	Angry T-Rex	Awsome game but....	YOU NEED TO FIX YOUR ADS LIKE OH MY GOD AN AD POPS UP AND I TRY PRESS THE TENNY TINY X BUTTON IT DOESENT WORK AND TAKES ME TOO A WEBSITE SO PRESS THE HOME BUTTON AND LOAD THE GAME AND IT HAS TO RESTART OTHER THAN THAT great game.

US	5	2017-02-26	2.7.0	Jennah1119	Relaxing	This game isn't that hard, so far, I really enjoy it.
US	4	2017-02-26	2.7.0	Alenta	Good	Not a bad game. Not to many games catches my attention but this one has.
US	4	2017-02-26	2.7.0	PieLover57	I really like it.	It is a fun game, but ads are annoying, and no matter how hard I try I cannot get a snow dragon.
US	5	2017-02-26	2.7.0	Fin and the only man	The game warden	The game was not a bad game
US	5	2017-02-26	2.7.0	__hxlie__	Best game ever!	I love this game! Even though it's gotta few bugs this game rocks!!💜💜💙💙❤️

US	5	2017-02-26	2.7.0	{Mick}	Overall a Fun Game	"I really enjoy the game especially the newest version.  I think the DML team come up with great new ideas to keep the game interesting.

However, I do wish they would change the clan dragon challenge to run over the weekend rather than to run during the working week."
US	4	2017-02-25	2.7.0	armyman123	Very Fun! Just one thing..	Super addictive, cute, and fun, Dragon Mania provides an overall good experience. The only thing I would suggest is please either get rid of the extremely intrusive ad pop ups or at least have an option to pay to get rid of them! That is all!
US	5	2017-02-25	2.7.0	CAnycegirl	Love it!	Addictive game
US	3	2017-02-25	2.7.0	50M30N3 5AVAG3	Addicting	not sure if addicting is good or bad, just some of the adds are inappropriate.
US	5	2017-02-25	2.7.0	Rjebebnenenejej	DragonML Is amazing!	I love this game it's a fun game especially you get to battle other players And I'm so addicted to It thanks for making it! :)
US	4	2017-02-25	2.7.0	Kmushka	Love this game	Very nice graphics and interface. Good game. But needs lots of time to grow up dragons if you don't buy diamonds and food.
US	3	2017-02-25	2.7.0	Hdunhappyfan	Ads	I love dragon mainia legends but don't like the constant interruptions from the ads, makes me not want to play, the balloon gives ads and that's fine but don't like it when they pop up every time you try to feed or train the dragons
US	4	2017-02-25	2.7.0	An 1242848473936382835337283	Love the game	The game is extremely fun and I love breeding and hatching new dragons. The game is so addicting but I love it!!! But the one complain I have is the VIP status I don't like it because so people can't afford to buy Jews and have to wait a long time. You should take out the VIP and make it so that everyone can breed certain dragons and don't have to be VIP
US	4	2017-02-25	2.7.0	Thesilencedakila11	A very addicting game but too many ads	This game is very very addictive there is only one small problem the the has way too many ads popping up blocking needed gameplay for players. An example is when you look at your islands and for some iOS players an ad usually pops up and keeps at a transparent screen with no way to get out eventually forces the device to glitch and exit out of the game on its own. Once that happens the player comes back in to the app and has to reload the whole game all over again. All I'm saying is please remove ads from the game. Mobile version of course.
US	5	2017-02-25	2.7.0	Nawaf Kalkattawi	From Nawaf	Amazing game

US	2	2017-02-25	2.7.0	MadPregnantMother	Glitches	Since this last update I can't play at all. It keeps going back to the loading page and not letting me do much. I can barely collect food and gold and even that takes me 6 times of it resetting.
US	5	2017-02-25	2.7.0	Nessy Cakess	Obsessed!!	This game is so addicting!
US	5	2017-02-25	2.7.0	Jaxonisabeast	Best game EVER....literaly	Thank you Gameloft for making this game. It's awesome. Even though the dragons look SO fake there SO cute. I thinks out should be able to evolve your dragons. Not breed but evolve. It's a great game to keep up with every day.
US	5	2017-02-25	2.7.0	Neg...!	Send gift to all button is missing	This is the best game I ever play and I play a lot of games so that means this game is really good the only thing we need is adding a button for sending gift to all friends with one button which we don't have right now and it's bother a lot

US	3	2017-02-25	2.7.0	Hayley Lind	Mostly great	"It stops being fun when you get to the point that battles aren't evenly matched- like with the ""defenders"" or when you're fighting other peoples' dragons in the arena. Maybe I went too high in rank while having too low of level, I don't know"
US	5	2017-02-25	2.7.0	MythsB	Love dragons! love this game!	This game has Great animation, awesome dragons, and addicting. If you love dragons get this game!
US	5	2017-02-25	2.7.0	LateWithItLuna	Love it!!	This is one of my favorite dragon games I've played thus far.

US	4	2017-02-24	2.7.0	CW Fan4	Fun and addictive	Developer is frequently coming up with updates. there are always new dragons and ways to get them. Would give 5 stars except there seems to be balance issues with power of dragons and consistency with damage, along with not enough space to acquire all the dragons in the game. Would recommend for a long term game. Powering up and leveling up dragons feels rewarding.
US	5	2017-02-24	2.7.0	Nika and ace kitty	Very fun	Exactly the title

US	4	2017-02-24	2.7.0	Sehaynes	One problem	I'm enjoying this game. My only complaint is the ads that pop up every 2 minutes. I already watch ad videos to do things several times each time I play. Why do ads pop up randomly and in a way that I accidentally click on it 80% of the time?! It's so annoying.
US	5	2017-02-24	2.7.0	Charlemange	Keeps getting better	This game is amazing. Always something to do and the developers are constantly adding new aspects to the game. Been playing for over a year!
US	5	2017-02-24	2.7.0	Colbert208	My review	I love the new additions to the game they are great but there is one thing that is really sad! I can't get anyone to let me join their group so every time I try to complete the challenges I can't ever get ahead! I think that if there is only one player in your group we should get more advances only because no one will let us join there group!
US	5	2017-02-24	2.7.0	Arvinsome	Dragon review	This game is awesome but frustrating because when you need to breed and another dragon is being born you could punch the wall out!
US	3	2017-02-24	2.7.0	Cartert79	It's fun	It's a fun game but some of the stuff take to long
US	5	2017-02-24	2.7.0	Raz4862	Dragon mania legend	I love this game it's awesome super addicting I only wish you had a chat place to talk to other people who play I think it would be super helpful
US	5	2017-02-24	2.7.0	Lovebraintease	Super fun	Love all the unique dragons and different body types.
US	4	2017-02-24	2.7.0	GiselC137	Definitely Amazing	This game is definitely enjoyable, more so for me because I love dragons. There is always something to do so it never gets boring, the only real issues I have with this game is how some events or dragons cost an insane amount of gems to win, sorry but I'm not shitting money so I wouldn't be able to justify spending for a game but they do balance this out by having ways to earn gems, slower but you can still earn them. Lastly when the internet connection is tampered with if I'm in a fight it wastes my energy and I'd have to battle again, wasting another energy, these are limited so if there was a way to fix that, definitely would be awesome.
US	5	2017-02-24	2.7.0	Cool cidzz	Itz fun	G3t 1T 1ts FunN l01 s00o fUN 11!!1!!!!!1!1!1!1!

US	5	2017-02-24	2.7.0	JMACAR14	LOVE THIS GAME!	Been playing this game for a couple of months now and I Love It!! It keeps getting better and better! This is a game for all ages!
US	4	2017-02-24	2.7.0	Ophelia Borges	Great	The only issue is the arena, you usually lose more points than you gain. :(
US	5	2017-02-24	1.4.1	zoolady777	Fun Game	Fun game.  The different types of dragons and habitats make it interesting, and watching their levels change as you feed them is entertaining.
US	4	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Megy36	So close to perfect	I love this game, but the biggest issue that I have is that ads pop up so much that it often makes it so that I accidentally leave the game
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Baddpuppy	Luv them Dino babies!	I luv the game.  The only thing I don't like is that I can't add any friends unless they are on my FB page.
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Zayaboi loves the game	Wooooooooow	Game is incredible
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Meoooooweth	Endless hours of fun :)	Love this game!
US	3	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Miri's mom	Fun but Flawed	It's a great game, the only complaint I have is the ridiculous expense involved in leveling up in my lifetime! I either pay $100 a pop for gems to buy food and enchantment supplies, or I spend a week farming 12 farms just to reach level 30 for ONE dragon. Unfortunately the expense of the game is going to see me giving it up soon.🙁😤🙁
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Sonny101 90	Dragon Mania	Great game. Keeps me going!
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	pinkbabydoll88	Really enjoy	I love playing this game on my off time the times are reasonable and I'm not forced to buy anything to pass a level and getting stuff is easy too
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	SunKissedButterfly	So far so good.	I've only been playing this game for about a week, so far I like it. Seems like a lot of fun. It's interesting and unique.
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Sarbear729	👍	Really fun game

US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Yeti talk	Fun to play	I like the variety of dragons and how the battle method. I think it is an awesome game and I'm excited to advance in it
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	FLAMESTAR!	Pretty fun	Well this game is a really fun game to play when your bored and have nothing else to do. The game is also addicting to play!
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	TammyTommie	In love ❤️	This game is truly addictive!!!!

US	4	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Prettymommylove	Wish things didn't cost so many coins.	Love it though
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Cheese muffins	I ❤ Dragon Mania Legends	"I have been playing dragon mania legends just a few days shy of two years straight now. It's the kind of game where you can login and do a few things and leave or you can spend more time and do more things. With the update I like the ability to get potions for the enchantment battles, that's the type of thing that I actually was wanting and they read my mind! I Love collecting all the different kinds of dragons.
I don't mind spending a few dollars here and there for entertainment but my only gripe is that there is not more farms that I can grow more food to feed my dragons."
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Mcbatman10	Love it	Great game. You should totally play it. So addictive
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	SubzeroExp	Love it!	I've absolutely loved playing this game! I thought that when I got it I'd be just like any other where you build habitats/collect gold/ expand, but really there is so much more! I recommend this game of that what you're looking for. Also, I think this one of the easiest games to gain gems in! Amazing!
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Aquarius H2️⃣0️⃣🚰	Fan Support	Great game love it and it just keep getting better. I will like to see this game brought to the tv ! this could be a very good anime .I got some interesting ideals for it too?and I sure that if the ideal get the OK . your staff imagine nation will run wild !fan support from all over will get behind it .but at the end of the day I love the game and want to be a small part of it thanks for you time hope you like my thoughts ♒️🌊🌬🎗🎟
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	demon619	DragonML	I Like Dragons
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Vgfxrhj	Love this game!!!	Tons of fun and tons of new challenges!!! Great job!
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Marshmallow101!!!?	Amazing!	I love this game so much. I've been playing it for months and haven't gotten tired of it, it's so amazing and fun!
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Suicune081	I like dragon mania legends	I love this game
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	Hooey 2309	Fun addictive game	Love the game and the super cute dragons!! But as with any game, upgrades on habitats and buildings take forever, most of the good things cost you gems and if you don't pay for them, kinda hard to accumulate as many as they ask for on some items. And once dragons reach a certain level feeding them is outrageous so I run out of food often.
US	5	2017-02-23	2.7.0	nexuswashere	Super fun!	This game is really fun and the designs for the dragons are interesting. There's nothing I don't like about the game as far as I've played it.
US	4	2017-02-23	2.7.0	A12wesome	Not bad of a game	It's fun and it's pretty entertaining but it's frustrating at some points
US	5	2017-02-23	2.6.1	Limeyloo	Super fun!	If it's the type of game you're into, then you'll definitely enjoy this one! Dragons are cool and cute, and the battling system keeps you more interested than just raising your cluster :3
US	5	2017-02-23	2.6.1	hilanm	Great game very addictive	I really enjoy this game, love the dragons. I feel the same as BioNicole1, I was worried about it being a Dragonvale knockoff, it's not. Feeding the dragons is frustrating because you can't produce it as quickly as they consume it. I do not really bother with using gems, I can't afford to use at the rate they are used. The game is still a lot of fun without using all that.
US	5	2017-02-23	2.6.0	Vaden24	Love this game	I just started playing this game and like it better than Dragon city. Very good graphics and gameplay!
US	4	2017-02-23	2.6.0	EZ05	Relaxing	The game is relaxing at the end of a busy day. I have enjoyed the game so far and I am looking forward to the next stages.
US	5	2017-02-23	2.5.1	owings7	BEST DRAGON GAME EVERRRRR	BETTER THEN ANY DRAGON GAME!!!
US	5	2017-02-23	1.9.2	[turbo100000]	Awesome game	This is the best update so far, bugs fixed, I can post to fb again after a year of not being able to, only draw back not enough islands to hold all habitats decorations and most important not enough habitats to accommodate all available dragons including bosses and legendary dragons. (Last years review) (this suggestion was actually implemented) I love this game. Been playing it for about a year now.  I like the ballon and the chance to win gems as well as other cool stuff, but It's virtually impossible to get gems now!  Haven't won but a couple gems on the ballon.  Game loft  should increase the gem winnings to say... 10 gems on the wheel to offset the time it takes to earn gems.
US	5	2017-02-22	2.7.0	Scru u dickbags	Love the game but...	I really really like the game. Ive been playing for a while now. Ever since the love dragon came out though, I have been trying to get it. Yes, all 20 something days I have been trying to get it with the Black Armor and Water dragons. It is the best combo, but I cant seem to get it. I know that it really doesnt matter, but i spent $50 on the game trying to get it. I am just sad, but enough ranting on. Love the game, thanks!
US	4	2017-02-22	2.7.0	Melme73	Love it	I absolutely love playing this game. And I think that one of the best things is even if I miss a day or two, I don't loose progress in my rewards.

US	2	2017-02-22	2.7.0	Bailsan94	Adds galore!	Really fun and enjoyable game but it's kind of ruined by all of the adds that pop up on the screen. It's very annoying and causes me to not play too often.
US	4	2017-02-22	2.7.0	flyjoyy	very good	the only question is that it's too hard.
US	5	2017-02-22	2.6.1	=SarahElaina=	Love	Tricked my fiancé into playing and now he loves it too.
US	5	2017-02-22	2.6.1	Tatta-Tot	Enjoy the game	Want to be able to win more scrolls, furry battle potion, and Red Battle Tokens, Blue Battle tokens
US	3	2017-02-22	2.6.1	Robin 0101	Ads pop up in the middle of play	This game is fun but frustrating. They have ads that pop that start at random while you are playing. They are super sensitive and take you away from the game more than most games I have played. We'll see how it goes after the latest update
US	5	2017-02-22	2.6.0	Cows and food	BEST GAME EVER!!!	This is the bomb.com I love the graphics and all the dragons and it's just perfect 👌!!!

US	5	2017-02-20	2.6.1	New Yorkers AJM	Love this game!!!	I've just started the game and really an awesome game! Graphic is very good... I'm enjoying :)
US	5	2017-02-20	2.6.1	Megamegmon	So much to do!	I came here to raise dragons and oh my god was it so much more. I get to take them into battle and the turn base system for battling feels familiar, fun, and challenging. High recommendations.
US	5	2017-02-19	2.6.1	Piper245678	Amazing!!!!	I've played this game for a long time and I am in love with it!!!!! I love how you can collect dragons. If I could I would give it seven stars!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
US	1	2017-02-19	2.6.1	macuser35	Problems with same itunes account	Two iPads at home but only one can play the game, the other gets booted. It seems to be related to some merged game feature. Why pop up that screen to a kid who doesn't know what to tap? Make this a setting for adults. Now we're hosed.
US	5	2017-02-18	2.6.1	No trees please	Automatic breeding	I absolutely love this game. I play literally 24/7. I have an idea that could make it better. Automatic Breeding. Where you could already have set who you want to breed next and then when the first pair get done breeding the egg can automatically find a place in the hatchery and when the egg is done hatching it can automatically find a habitat to live in. So when you are away you can still be breeding and hatching eggs nonstop. Well unless you run out of habitats then you need to go buy some more. LOL well hope you guys see this and hope you take my idea into consideration. Thank you for making this awesome game.
US	2	2017-02-17	2.6.1	Bohanmc	Was fun, but broken now.	The latest update is causing problem. The game prompts you to download more data, but the actual download keeps failing because it says the data has 0.00 MB. This game is not playable now.
US	2	2017-02-17	2.6.1	TheR3v3lator	They ban you after you pay	"Just got a perma ban after I bought the ruby pack with 50 percent discount with iTunes gift card which means that the transaction surely didn't fail. The title stated multiple times of ""offence"" and ""cheating"" and I didn't even enter the arena(never wanted the multiplayer) nor did I unlock it till the very last minutes. My advice, play this adorable game as much as you want, but DO NOT make any purchases from gameloft. They give you pay to win offers then ban you for ""playing unfair""."
US	4	2017-02-16	2.6.1	LeahF2189	Yes, please.	"Easily the most addictive game I've ever downloaded on my phone. There is so much to do as you advance in the game, so it never loses its appeal. 

I request that either food become easier to obtain, or feeding costs should lower. Enough to remain a challenge, but lowered substantially enough to be able to keep up with the level you're on. 

Other than that, I love everything about Dragonmania Legends. I highly recommend it. :)"
US	5	2017-02-16	2.6.1	Animatronic dragon	The new dragon	I want a dragon that looks like a animatronic with a cool touch animation!😗😏👍🏻🐉
US	5	2017-02-15	2.6.1	Tlbarnes1969	Nice	Thank you
US	3	2017-02-15	2.6.1	jordynfune	Excessive Amounts of Advertisement	This is my favorite game to pass time. It's fun and there's always new tasks and features to play with. But the ads are ridiculous. Pop up ads appear out of no where and I'm constantly redirected to my internet browser and App Store. It's frustrating and completely takes away from the game. Dragon Mania Legends should have gotten five stars but lost two because of inconvenient advertisements.
US	1	2017-02-13	2.6.1	not happy but mad	Not a bad game, but too many adds that kills my appretier in 5 days	The adds seems like more important than the game itself. First 10 second you open the game the add is right on your face occupying the entire screen. Most of the time, you will accidentally tap on the adds during playing the game and jump to safari and App Store. Wondering if this game is for promoting for other apps for its main purpose. Very  annoying. The frequency of those adds are also too much. Every 3 mins you will have to see highly repeating adds. You will think since they have so many adds so the things they sell you with your real money will be less NO, it's not. Not a game for a long term.
US	5	2017-02-12	2.6.1	Nye2004	Love it	This game litt because the dragons are so cute mostly wean they are babies
US	5	2017-02-12	2.6.1	Rooting for me 243	Great game	The dragons are the cutest things I've ever seen, but when you get certain things it takes forever to load. But overall it's a great game to play.

US	4	2017-02-11	2.6.1	Rcorps	Lots of fun	Good way to past the time
US	1	2017-02-11	2.6.1	$&27):99 q	Good except racist dragons!	"I love this game. Except.

Ceremony, Tribal and Genie are all hella racist dragon types. It's disappointing that such a cute game has 3 hurtful stereotypes in it. I'd be delighted to change to a 5 star review if these 3 dragons go and the designers take some time to read up on indigenous people and what they go through. Thanks!

Love the game, hate racism!"
US	5	2017-02-11	2.6.1	kavsud	I LOVE THIS APP!!!	This app is so fun! I recommend it for people of any age. If you do download the app,please write a review and tell me what you think of it. This app is very adventurous. Just remember to have fun. 😊

US	4	2017-02-06	2.6.1	Rocknroger	It's fun	It's a fun game but you better have patience if your not planning on spending real cash, same as all the in app games now days. I play the game along with a couple other games to make it easier to deal with the wait times. These kinds of games are only fun if you patients. The graphics are nice it's a fun game.
US	5	2017-02-06	2.6.1	Fhjssbkhdgj	Great game	1 problem it needs wifi otherwise great game
US	4	2017-02-06	2.6.1	CMole1	Nice gameplay, too many pop up ads	"I really enjoy the variety of the activities, challenges, and overall gameplay.  Unfortunately, all these are frequently interrupted by unsolicited pop-up ads.  There is a nice feature where you can choose to watch an ad for a small reward.  However, the unrequested pop-ups happen at random times and all-too frequently. They also negatively impact game play (such as petting dragons) and cause further disruption.

I know ""free"" games come at a cost but with sufficient opportunities for income through player purchases, it feels like the plethora of pop-up ads is a money grab."
US	5	2017-02-05	2.6.1	🤓⭐️️🤓⭐️️🤓⭐️️🤓⭐️️❤️	Five star ⭐️	It's awesome I mean there are some cons like too many adds but  you get to battle and fight breed new dragons 🐉 just it's an awesome game so get it it's great 👍🏻

US	3	2017-02-05	2.6.1	Brittaney Johnson	Too many pop up adds	I love this game a lot and sit up late playing it just to meet goals that I've started. My only problem is the number of adds that pop up during game play. This game would be so much more fun if the adds didn't pop up every few minutes. Please get rid of them!!!! This game is a lot of fun to play, but the adds just kill it completely. I'll be petting my dragons and an add will pop up out of nowhere. Get rid of them please!!! And don't have us dish out cash just to get rid of them either.
US	4	2017-02-05	2.6.1	Beastin<3	Adding friends based on server	"Love this game.. Not happy that I can not have my friends that have androids or have a different server join my clan or even be in my friends list! It would be more fun to play if you could have friends on different platforms and servers be able to join you. 
I don't really want to add random people to my Facebook (etc.) just to get friends on my friends list in game, which is non existent because of the separation.
Can something please be done about this?"

US	1	2017-02-04	2.6.1	Louiext	Tons of pop up ads, Mediocre gameplay	The gameplay is okay, but not well thought out. The game has potential... but Ads will pop up every 30 seconds or so, regardless of what you're doing. If the developers spent more time making the gameplay better and less time trying to trick the user into clicking ads, this might be a good game.

US	3	2017-02-03	2.6.1	Jctyubcsulmb	Black dragons	Me and 3-4 other people are having problems with our dragons being black and not being able to click on them or battle. It says we have to download them but it won't work 😩
US	5	2017-02-03	2.6.1	Tearilis	Best game ever	No words just awesome
US	3	2017-02-02	2.6.1	JUSTYCE BROWN	Stops my music	Really fun game but very expensive! Can be addictive! My only complaint is how it stops the music I'm listening to. It never did so until the new update, if it continues I will stop playing!!!
US	2	2017-02-02	2.6.1	Shzhsjabzh	Too many adds and ridiculous waits	The game seems fun. But this game incorporates way too many adds, you'll be playing and it'll an add will pop up outta nowhere. I've played very similar games to this and they don't require adds. The wait times for everything are way too long. Breeding, growing food, especially when just starting out on the game. Some upgrades also cost just and not the play money you earn and I'm not talking upgrades you make at level 50 like just started playing this week and you wanna do the first upgrade and it's 150 gems so you'd literally have to pay or wait weeks. DragonVale is better!

US	5	2017-02-02	2.6.1	Gggggggiyhtnsk	I Recommend	This is a great game that is built up over time, I have    loved slowly building up my dragon army. Great Game Totally Recommend.
US	4	2017-02-02	2.6.1	Some girl 927926102974	dragons and stuff	the dragons are super cute and it's a fun game and it's not too tedious waiting for things to level up and it always gives you new tasks to complete.
US	2	2017-02-02	2.6.1	I hate this game128499582771:	Too many adds/ bad design	"I just downloaded the game and I'm already tired of it because of all the random adds ever couple of minutes..

I've been playing this game for awhile and it has really bad design. You can't do anything in a descent amount of time without spending money. Dragons only level up by feeding them not by fighting/battling and food is expensive and a good amount takes time, only way to speed it up is gems and you can't get gems without money in one way or another or it takes you DAYS to get 5 gems which isn't enough. You can't move items on your land or sell them like most games you can only pay thousands of coins to destroy them also takes time depending on size of tree or flower... the cheapest land to buy is 300,000 and I've barley been over 100,000 and I payed to get the 100,000 coins. You can't get coins fast enough dragons give 1,000 coins every 2 hours. 
The game is fun when you can play it but it takes and cost far too much to do or make any progress in this game... I'm no longer going to play this game. I can spend less money and make more progress in the other games I have.

If you breed a dragon it takes about 1hr 30min with VIP2 and I did the same breeding again because I didn't get the dragon I wanted and it's now 5hrs with VIP2."

US	4	2017-01-31	2.6.1	TanaaaaaB	Addicting!	I love this game and wish I could give it a full five stars; the one fault is that it has too many ads. You can skip the ads after a number of seconds but still annoying.

I mean DragonCity and them cost you more money if you want to get anywhere in the side games!! I mean you have to buy a bunch of gems to be able to get anywhere. I've been stuck one this one part for around a year because of one dragon!!!! Anyway lOVE this dragon game!!!!!
US	5	2017-01-28	2.6.1	Minecraft ❓it rocks	Omg	This is literally my favorite game. I'm on like 9 and I just got it like a hour ago. P.s. It's 10:30 now.
US	5	2017-01-28	2.6.1	Dakota4756	Favorite!!	I've been playing this game for probably about 8 months now (much longer than any other game I've ever downloaded). It is visually spectacular! Battling mechanics never get old! Dragon designs are very unique! There is plenty of things to do keeping this game addictive. Since they've taken away the ads every five minutes, it has been a much better playing experience. All and all the game is worthy of a five star rating, but what else would you expect from the greatest company on the App Store gameloft!!
US	5	2017-01-28	2.6.1	LadyMacbeth1124	Easy fun game	Fun simple game with great graphics. Easy to get into collecting all the different dragons, expanding and decorating the different islands. A bit redundant at times but worth playing.

US	5	2017-01-27	2.6.1	MrsLovenborg	Dope game!	I'm not usually into these kinds of games, but this one is actually extremely addictive and fun. Always something to do, and it's not just battling. Love it. Would definitely recommend to get this game.
US	4	2017-01-27	2.6.1	Lady3l	Ad	Could you please stop with all the ads. If an ad come up while I'm collecting money from my dragons I don't get to collect the rest once the add is over.  Leave the ads for spinning the wheel. But besides that I like this game.
US	2	2017-01-27	2.6.1	MegaAbsol24	Stop the random ads	Stop ads from popping up in the middle of the play it's making me mad... >:( ... I don't like play this all the time do to the ads.... Get rid of them and I'll play more

US	5	2017-01-27	2.6.1	Allofus4	Great fun	I have four girls ages 6 to 13 and we all play this game it's so fun to see who gets what dragon and ask them how they got that dragon who gets rewards. Someone is always saying oh look at what I got and it's just great fun. I love that you can earn cool dragons in your battles and that there's events that go on and that you can earn gems and do lots of stuff without them having to pay

US	3	2017-01-27	2.6.1	Mortae	A disappointment	Everything in this game is geared more for people to spend their money than play a game.  One can't even compete on any level without paying to be a VIP.  Sat am away from this mess.  Such a blatant mechanic deserves nothing more than a nod.  At the same time I am playing it more.  They do offer items with promotions and quests.

US	4	2017-01-26	2.6.1	Mbogita	Great game, ads and breeding timers kill though	This is a very nice game, because you aren't just collecting the dragons and building your island, but you can battle with them too. The ads every 5 minutes are a real pain, truly horrible. Also the amount of time it takes to breed thing has made it literally impossible to get the monthly dragon, cause you get stuck with 8 hour timers every time. Otherwise a fun game. 😄

US	5	2017-01-25	2.6.1	Jpesh 2222	Great game!	If you like dragons and collecting things then this is a game for you. The pvp system is simple and not too demanding. Breeding dragons is really fun but don't expect to always get the dragon you want on the first try. They have a neat clan system. Only thing that's slightly annoying is how much food you need to level dragons past 10 but that's understandable, I mean, it is a free game.
US	4	2017-01-25	2.6.1	BioNichole1	A little rough along the scales	"I am really enjoying this game! I am absolutely enameled with the art style of the dragons; I can't tell if it's 2D or 3D animated, and I LOVE THAT. At first I was worried this game would turn out to be a DragonVale knockoff, but I was happily proved wrong! However, it's still rough around the edges. Gem usage is almost irrelevant due to how expensive speed ups are, even when there's not a lot of time to speed up—I spend days saving them up only to use them all in one play session. Feeding costs are also in need of a change; though the price doubling with every level isn't so bad from 1-8, but once it reaches triple digits it quickly grows troublesome to the point of frustration.

Other than that, and a few minor things escaping me at the moment, this game has a lot of potential to be a stellar dragon game. I have a hard enough time finding good-quality dragon games as it is, so I sincerely want to see this game get even better."
US	5	2017-01-25	2.6.1	Duckfan4963	Love Dragon Mania Legends!!	This is a fun game that I finally feel you don't have to continue to pay to play. It's possible to enjoy the game and collect free stuff.
US	3	2017-01-25	2.6.1	Dmneufhdgsbeop	Too many ads	I like the game, but there are way to many pop up ads.  There are so many that I'm about ready to quit playing.
US	5	2017-01-25	2.6.1	Hardstyle flavor	Addicted!!	At first I didnt know if I was interested in the game.. then my wife pushed me to get it and now im on it 24/7 lol Definitely fun!
US	3	2017-01-25	2.6.1	;) cyn79 ;)	Advertisement	Fun game but too many advertisements..... too many interruptions with the advertisement....
US	3	2017-01-25	2.6.1	Tagic	Your call	This game is ok. What makes it just ok is the fact that right in the middle of game play, an add will pop up. Most games have a way to earn certain items by watching adds. This game does have that feature, but it still has the interrupting adds. If the interruptions were removed from the game, it would be much better. As it is, I may stop playing it for that reason.
US	5	2017-01-25	2.6.1	KTberrie	Best game ever!!	This is the most addictive game ever. I love it. The dragons are adorable, the graphics are great. I find myself waking up in the middle of the night to maintain my island. I've never spent much time on games. But this one has me hooked 🙃
US	2	2017-01-25	2.6.1	Thunder cuddles✨	But the commercials though.!!!	The game is fun but idk how much longer I can take the commercials. They redirect you to some stupid app every 5seconds it's too much.  If you fix that let me know and I'll come back and play 🙂

US	2	2017-01-25	2.6.1	AnubusPrime	Lack of imagination	"There's little to no difference in the dragons, except in the visual creativity. Every dragon with water powers does the same as every other dragon with water powers. Etc etc. The story is insanely difficult way to early. ""Hey I should have no problem betting that boss who's at level 8"". 😑One shotted by an element that has no benefit against my dragon. Change the fact that I still have to wait 8 hours for a dragon I've already hatched 9 times. This game has promise but right now is nothing to spread the word about."

Or when I press ""x"" to close the ad, it opens the link in the browser.  My son and I loved the game on appleTV and on my iPad, which didn't have ads. I will not be purchasing anything in the app due to the ads. 

Without the ads, its a 5 star game."

US	4	2017-01-22	2.6.0	PuppyGirl890	Ups and Downs	Okay so with an overall view the game is pretty good. I like the basics of the game it is really fun and you can do a lot. 😀But there are a few things I think need to be changed in the newest version. When you are training your dragons you need scrolls which you get from battling, but I think that this shouldn't require that. This should have no cost. Why do most dragons take 30 seconds to breed while others might take an hour? When you are removing things like trees and rocks it cost from 1,000 to 4,000 gold. That is crazy. This price should be way less.  Like 50 for small trees and rocks and 100 for bigger ones.  But overall the game is good I just wish that in the next version these simple things would be fixed. I will rate this game again either later in the game or when the next version comes out. I want to be more impressed when  I rate again. 😔

US	5	2017-01-20	2.6.0	Josh gj	Suggestion for next update	I suggest that on the shops, you should add a search bar at the side and you can search part of the name and the object you wanna buy appears
US	2	2017-01-20	2.6.0	TheWanderingPonderer	Training should last forever	"It's bs that after training attack only stays higher ""for a time"" not worth the effort, this is just part of what ruins this otherwise awesome game, That  and the fact that diamonds are practically impossible to find so you either buy the overpriced fake money, or play for 37 years to build up enough to do anything with. Also this game is pretty much just a giant trick to get kids to join Facebook, why cant we use friends from the gamecenter? Also the wait times  are insane like 12 hours for like 1500 food, my leveled up dragons eat that in one gulp, 4-18 hours for mating + 3-18 hours for eggs to grow.
Fix these issues and you'll get a five , but I'm sure you won't because most of your users are rich little kids who's parents give them all the money they want.  Unsatisfied"

US	4	2017-01-17	2.6.0	Lovestoread🍓🍓	Addicting! But there are a few hated things	"I absolutely love this game!!! It's super fun! I love how many different dragons they have! I swear they have like 500 different dragons. Plus, they come up with new ones every week! One thing I wish they would change, is that every dragon would have its own UNIQUE power, instead throughout the whole game they only have like 13 different powers. Also, the ads that pop up every 5 seconds when I'm trying to play are super annoying!! I hate them! Ugh😔 Although, this game it awesome, it would be amazing if they would fix the things I mentioned! Anyway, I gave this game 4 stars b/c I just can't stand the ads and that the dragons don't have their power, as I said before. 

This is for the game makers, suggesting how to use my ideas.

I really suggest that if they make a 2nd game, to give the dragons their own powers. And as far as habitats go you could use just only 1 habitat for all dragon types(kind of like the legendary habitat). I hope that these suggestions with help!"

US	3	2017-01-17	2.6.0	Jenny_123	Fun but....	This is a super fun game but the ads are out of control!!! With so much promotion on social media I wouldn't think there would be so many. They just pop up out of nowhere. It's an inconvenience.
US	4	2017-01-17	2.6.0	LpsBreGaming	It's ok but......	"I got the radiant dragon not to long ago
And I can't get the metal habitat cause it says I have 13/13 but I never got one before"

US	1	2017-01-17	2.6.0	TheDoctor1975	I give up on this game	I deleted this game to make room since I stopped playing. However I was wanting to get back into playing it but it takes me back to the very beginning, so I think to myself, maybe I need to try connecting to my social media but it never connected...
US	5	2017-01-16	2.6.0	Nutmeg81987	Dragon Mania Legends	Its a fun game..
US	1	2017-01-16	2.6.0	Cdubs1721	BE CAREFUL WHEN MAKING PURCHASES	"Especially the ""VIP"" offer!

This game tricked a child into making purchases and charged a lot of money to their parent's credit card.  

Proceed with caution!"
US	5	2017-01-16	2.6.0	Rjbrenay.	Awesome	One of the best games
US	2	2017-01-16	2.6.0	Rainy Eve	I like this game but really hate the ad	"Almost every free game have ads, that doesn't bother me. What bothers me is the way they display it. The ad just pops up when you try to focus on something, and you can't close it! There is an x over there but it's more like decoration. Sometimes there are videos ad and it just keep replying and can not be closed in any way force me to close the game and reopen it. I have written customer service messages to them and they just ignored. 
So although this is so far my favorite dragon game, I JUST HATE THE WAY THE AD DISPLAY!"

US	1	2017-01-15	2.6.0	Brunettegurl6402	Too many annoying ads that ruin the experience	It is a fun game but there are way too many ads that ruin it! Will be deleting because of it. The ads will just randomly pop up while you're playing and you can't play until the video is over.
US	1	2017-01-15	2.6.0	Me3747581	Could be fun if...	The ads on this game are so often and so annoying. I went to train a dragon and spent 1000 coins, when an ad popped up and then after it said training unsuccessful! You can't much more annoying. I'm sad and did like this game but I'm deleting it. They should take some notes off of Dragonvale world. I'm hooked on that game forever!

US	5	2017-01-14	2.6.0	Mindiejo	Love	Love the game! I wish it didn't cost so much to do some things. Other than that it is a fun game :)
US	4	2017-01-13	2.6.0	CS05142016	A suggestion...	I've only had this game a few days and I love it. It fits right into my style of mobile RPG-ish games. One suggestion though: change how you do the ads. I know free games need sponsors. I know I gotta sit through 30-second ads. I know the same ads will play over and over. I'm good with all that. What I'm not good with is an ad popping up every 15 seconds when I'm in the middle of gameplay. Farmville 2 has a great way of showing ads without interrupting gameplay. They allow you to choose when to watch the ads, and award keys and other prizes for watching them. Might wanna consider somethin like that, or people like myself might become disinterested in this wonderful game.

US	5	2017-01-06	2.6.0	insomanycolors	Great Free Game	"There are a lot of ""free"" app games that become quickly frustrating and boring unless you pay to play, but this is not one of those. It continues to be fun whether you choose to pay into it for cool content and upgrades or just choose to play for free. Of course, there are certain things you can't acquire without paying but there are just as many cool things to get for free. There are many facets of this game to explore, whether it's breeding new dragons, leveling up and fighting the Vikings, playing against other players, or exploring new parts of the world. Definitely recommend trying it out for anyone into app-based gaming, or just cute little dragons."

US	1	2017-01-04	2.6.0	Eherrera05	The pop up ads are the worst	I understand  that with free apps comes ads but when they pop up on the screen during gameplay that is one of the worst things a game developer can allow. There is a video that pops up in the middle of me trying to complete a mission that won't go away, I have to force close the app and after doing that it still pops up making playing the game impossible. If this is not addressed I'll be uninstalling.
US	4	2017-01-04	2.6.0	Hammyster1	Harambe	I personally LOVE dragons and this is an amazing game but sometimes the icons or symbols for different things don't match what it does and it's hard to find certain things I'm looking for, but overall great game! And A LOT OF FUN!
US	5	2017-01-03	2.6.0	gctg99	Love it	Very cool, very entertaining. Used to play it a few years back; stumbled upon it a couple of days ago and am very impressed with the upgrade. Great job!
US	5	2017-01-03	2.6.0	LIL'T HIGGIE	one of the best IOS games I've played!	I really like this game one of my favorite games on the app stores. Although it has flaws I can definitely look passed them. it's fun creative just what kind of game I want. but if the creators could make the islands less expensive because I barely have enough coins to buy a new habitat. also if you could make the time on dragon breeding and hatching faster that would be good too!

US	1	2017-01-02	2.6.0	Frig05	Too many ads!	I really like this game, but can't play as I should be able to. Between the in app promotions taking up a lot of the screen and the other ads constantly popping up and often redirecting to websites, it's very frustrating. I understand having ads in a free game, but the high volume is what is frustrating. I have played other GameLoft games that do not have this problem. I'm going to try to continue with the game for now because I do enjoy it, but will probably end up deleting it. If the ads were reduced, I would definitely give this app a higher rating.
US	5	2017-01-02	2.6.0	Babyygirll💋	Addicted	I'm officially Addicted to this game. Is fun it passes time and they game is all in all great! I love how you can't battle them and you get better every time I did have to pay but to be honest it was worth is the game is more fun now. But then again I only paid like $6.99 so that's not bad but I would recommend this to everyone who doesn't mind paying

You can be in the middle of clicking something and an ad pop up right as you're clicking whatever it is. Annoying. The game was obviously created by greedy people.

Well I got a few breeding ideas try breeding a lava dragon with a candy dragon I got a epic dragon I don't want to spoil it then when you get it to level four breed it with another dragon I got a legendary but it may not work I'm just warning you that it might not work but breed whatever you want I'm not gonna tell you what to do.🤗

US	2	2016-12-29	2.6.0	Horselover521	Having Issues	This game somehow confused my game with my sisers. I created a new Game Center and stared over just to make it right. And I was super far in the game and then all of a sudden it put me on my sisters account and I can't get back to mine. I love this game but I contacted them with a question of how to fix it and they never replied. I am very angry and upset by this. It also won't let me start over which means I can't ever play this app again.

There's only one problem......
You need like a million gems but they're way to hard to get. You have to pay for too much stuff with gems. I really wish they will fix that in a update."

US	2	2016-12-28	2.6.0	Mergcity	Meh	I like the game and it's fun but now I remember why I got rid of it the first time. The app randomly kicks me off and resets taking the spent energy from a battle before I can even start battling!!! Plus it goes into random adds as I am trying to move about the app or do things. (iPhone 5s, up to date if anyone wonders)

Images of dragons won't load, slow and glitchy, lack of loading on anything in general actually. 
I used to play this game every evening after work & now I don't play it at all because the glitches were THAT annoying.

Please fix issues so I can play again!!!! 😊😊😊"

US	4	2016-12-21	2.6.0	I heart cats	Alright	"This game is very fun and addicting. This is very time consuming and great for animal lovers :). The battles are challenging yet fun.
 There are cons though. For instance, what with all the ads? Every time I close out of something in the app, an ad pops up, right before I do something an ad pops up! It gets very annoying. Then there is the financial issues. Everything cost way to much money and almost everything is bought with gems which are hard to get. Also, for two of the dragons I'm breeding, it'll take 12 hours to finish! As with some dragons it only takes 30 seconds. One last thing, when you don't have any quests, or you run out of energy, there is not much to do on the app, there should be like mini games or something.
 Don't let these cons fool you though, the game is still fun and worth getting."
US	5	2016-12-21	2.6.0	scboy30	Love this game	This game is so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!
US	2	2016-12-21	2.6.0	AlchEmmy	Come on, man	You made a pretty cool game, steps ahead of other dragon city type games.. and then you ruin it with ads. So many intrusive ads... I'd rather find a different game than have my gameplay interrupted every minute by some complete overlay. I tried sticking with it because I like some of the different aspects, but it's not worth dealing with the ads. Maybe I'll try again another day.
US	5	2016-12-21	2.6.0	Aapock	Lot better!!	Tried getting into a few other dragon games similar to this one and all became waaay to aggravating or dull too quick. This one is awesome and keeps me entertained for Hours! Way better than any other I've played.
US	5	2016-12-20	2.6.0	Rayet Areash	Love it but error Facebook login :c	It won't let me login into Facebook ;-; but I really love the game.
US	2	2016-12-20	2.6.0	AKosDaBoss	Pop-Up Ads	"I want to give this game 5 stars because it's so fun, but I can't. The frequent, annoying pop-up ads get in the way quite badly. I've never seen such a blatant disrespect for the customer, due to financial greed. The game itself, however, is fantastic. Thanks to the ads, I would give it 1 star if it weren't for the fact that this has the ""it factor"" that other games like it are lacking."
US	5	2016-12-20	2.6.0	Brendon Kelley	Dragon legend	Yes I am enjoying the game
US	5	2016-12-19	2.6.0	Bhggggggdsfh	Good	Good
US	5	2016-12-19	2.6.0	Meganpuffin	Dragons	Fun and cute I really seem to get bored with others app games easily especially ones you have to wait for things to build and whatnot but this has got me hooked lots to do to keep busy and interesting love  it
US	5	2016-12-19	2.6.0	Lanna@???	Amazing	One of the best games I have ever played. Has amazing graphics and is so much fun!
US	4	2016-12-19	2.6.0	Ecarg9412	Great Game, Great Adventure, Great Animation... 1 MAJOR problem.	This game is the most adventurous dragon game I've ever owned. I love the dragon animations and the fact that you can interact with them and see their responses. Also, it's the best kind of strategic battle layout I've seen in a game like this, and it goes well with the schooling and training offered for your dragons to defend and boost battle tactics, but if there was one thing I'd fix, it would be that habitats are nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get past level 16! Either allow for more than 1 extra habitat every time I level up or let me increase the capacity of the ones I already have, even if it takes up more space.
US	5	2016-12-18	2.6.0	Akumanny	FUN	Really fun.... add my code and get free items...9718b9
US	5	2016-12-18	2.6.0	Johnjihns	"""Hey,that's pretty good"	Ok

US	1	2016-12-18	2.6.0	Candy troll	No longer amazing	I can't access half the features. It's been a month and still waiting for it to be fixed. Says I need to download additional data but it won't let me. About to give up and delete it!
US	1	2016-12-18	2.6.0	Vikky7	Disappointed	I previously had this game and it was fun, but now it has to many ads and they want money for everything, disappointed
US	2	2016-12-18	2.6.0	Awesome star some	Cool but dumb	I hate trying to get lengandaries. I finally got a lengendary 🤗 buuuuut the collect as much gold as u can from any sources I'm always in last place never getting the grand prize and my teamates don't talk in my clan! Please make events a little easier! It's impossible to win even tho I collected tuns of gold! So I'm giving it a 2 star until things r easier! Merry Christmas 🎁🎄! Oh and also can u make the feeding cost a little less on the 🐉's and give us a daily bonus of either food or gems because I can store up lots of fruit but loose it all because of feeding so pls make daily bonuses and extra breeding! And the clan dragons take a lot of hatching chips just to get it! We have to keep hatching it until we have like fourty! Make things easier and fix the messes up and bugs! 🐜
US	5	2016-12-17	2.6.0	Hudak420	Best game ever	I love this game I was watching a YouTube video and saw this I said to my self I need to get this game I love this game soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo mush 😍💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
US	4	2016-12-17	2.6.0	Dragon awesomeness legends	Super awesome	This game is awesome
US	3	2016-12-17	2.6.0	StephieeeDeee	I love it! Add me c49254	So I love this game. What I don't love about it are the super intrusive ads that pop up at what seems to be 30-60 second intervals. It's really annoying. They even pop up when you're about to battle or train and mess you up and freeze the screen even. It needs to go or be changed so that they don't pop up as often and definitely not when you're in the middle of something.
US	2	2016-12-17	2.6.0	Artigius	Fun game, ruined by invasive ads	"The game is solid - collect dragons and raise them, allowing you to battle and increase revenue in other ways.  Breeding based on dragon attributes and RNG is well done.  The battle system, although it could use some tweaks, is very playable, and allows for strategy and skill while not being fully dependent on it.

However, enjoyment of the game is often interrupted by overlay ads, some images and some videos.  On its own, it would be tolerable, especially as games require revenue to design, implement, and run.  But the ads often don't allow you to simply exit the ad, and instead open up your web browser leading you to sketchy websites.  This drops the otherwise enjoyable experience of the game dramatically, as well as the trustworthiness of the publisher.

For this reason, I'm resigned to giving an otherwise 4-star game a generous 2 stars.  It will also be the reason I remove the game from my device.  As fun as the game itself can be, it's frustrating to constantly have my browser window opened against my will, and I simply don't trust the sites that are opened up."
US	5	2016-12-17	2.6.0	Cjaure0003	Dragon mania legonds	It is really fun to play it is better than monster legonds the graphics are really good in dragon mania legonds
US	5	2016-12-16	2.6.0	Sasodert	روعة	حلوة
US	5	2016-12-16	2.6.0	Addylovesmuffins	AWESOME!❤️❤️	It's a really fun game to play! I can't stop playing it! I recommend this game to anyone!😊
US	2	2016-12-15	2.6.0	JoJo01234	Too many intrusive ads	The ads in this game are out of control. I can't play more than 30 seconds at a time without having to close out the game. I'd rather pay a few bucks for an ad-free version.
US	5	2016-12-15	2.6.0	puppybow	cute puppy	do you know how you can update
US	3	2016-12-15	2.6.0	Ikapreciado	Update disaster	"After the last update I breed new dragons and got a new island and now overnight everything is gone !! Wth happened?? 
I love the game and this is discouraging ):"
US	1	2016-12-15	2.6.0	NightRay	Can't play	The game says update required but there is no update date in the app store
US	3	2016-12-15	2.6.0	Rae Rae ✌🏼️	I hate the update!!😡	Before I got the update my Phoenix dragon was breeding then when I logged on the next day it deleted it and some of my progress was deleted !! SMH!!😡😡
US	2	2016-12-15	2.6.0	Lady Barefoot	The ads are ridiculous!	Overall, the game is fun to play. The dragons are really cute and the missions are relatively easy to complete. I actually feel like I'm making serious progress in the game. However, the ads are really beginning to annoy me. I'll be reading something or be right in the middle of feeding a dragon or whatever and it will just play an ad without warning almost every minute. The ones that really bother me are the videos that you can't skip or get to stop repeatedly playing because that's exactly what they do. It was only like 15 seconds long but it kept playing and playing. The only thing I can do to stop it is by minimizing the ad. Seriously?! You guys need to chill on the ads. One every single minute will hinder gameplay and it has.
US	3	2016-12-15	2.6.0	Jnh363	Erases everything	This will eventually erase mainly all of your data that you have been playing it is a fun game to play with just be careful with the game
US	5	2016-12-15	2.6.0	Stanzalady	Fix this App Please	I love playing this game but now it won't let me in. There is a page that keeps wanting me to update the app but there are no updates.
US	5	2016-12-15	2.6.0	Ariakhan28	Atiakhan2843	Yes
US	3	2016-12-15	2.6.0	TallCaliGirl63	❤️IT❣️	Great game that I play with my four year old grandson who for the most understands how the game is played and he loves it as much as I do. We do quite well without having to purchase items. He gets upset if I do anything without him being present.
US	5	2016-12-15	2.6.0	Soafaloaf	Beautiful Game	I just got this but the tutorial was done with so much care and the game is just so beautiful that I had to drop a review for it. The habitats actually move! And the feeding animation is so much fun. I can tell I'm going to really love this app 😄
US	4	2016-12-15	2.6.0	CA$hflo91	Fun game.	Need more instructions on how to breed dragons more accurately.
US	1	2016-12-15	2.6.0	Giant Clam	Glitches & bugs	"Lost a dragon while attempting to move it...
Whether or not I sold it by mistake or there was a game glitch, don't expect to get it back."

US	5	2016-12-14	2.6.0	SSGokuis4ever	Great game!	My wife started playing the game first then I played for a few moments and I was hooked. lol I play the game everyday.... never boring. Great for kids too!
US	5	2016-12-14	2.6.0	Mcaldy	Shablownca	The best game ever
US	3	2016-12-14	2.6.0	Tickle master xD	Feedback	So, I love the game but I don't like that we can only breed at one time. I also don't like that we can't give friends any dragons that take forever to hatch and we just have to sell versus keeping them. Other than that I love the game
US	5	2016-12-14	2.6.0	batmans6	Awesome	This game is rade
US	4	2016-12-14	2.6.0	Hector10315	Good but...	Loving the game but could use new and different elements and dragons
US	5	2016-12-14	2.6.0	Dobadane	Great game	Play it all the time
US	4	2016-12-14	2.6.0	I'mfrustratedbcmynamewastaken	Super fun! But takes up too much memory.	I downloaded the game and really enjoyed it! I love breeding the dragons and making all kinds of cute combos! The feeding is fun but too costly! Battling is great too! Upping skills is fun but the scrolls are too hard to get. I would play games just for the scrolls. ;) I also really like exploring for treasure. The pvp is fun and it would be nice to have your dragons level up by battling too. Not just by food. I'd like to be able to buy nests too! So I can breed more than 1 dragon at a time. There are a lot of adds for a game that has in game purchases and if the size of the app grows any bigger, I'll have to stop playing because I won't have space on my phone along with al the other things I have on my phone that are more important.
US	5	2016-12-14	2.6.0	Coolrfs	Nice game	👍🏼
US	2	2016-12-14	2.6.0	patgal5492	The Ads and unskippable movies kill this game	"I play a lot of these types of games and the ads are clearly the worst in this one.
Tedious grinding for food is bad enough, but the horrific Ad abuse makes this game barely playable."
US	5	2016-12-14	2.6.0	Trikiric	I changed my mind	I honestly didn't think this game would be fun.  I started playing then I found myself intrigued and then i found myself playing on my breaks at work. I really enjoy playing this game and I promise you will find yourself playing too , if you start. Once you start playing you'll get hooked like I did.

US	1	2016-12-10	2.5.2	Skrtf	Pop up ads are a game killer	Might be a fun little game but the ads constantly popping up to take over the whole screen all the time really kills the pleasure in it.
US	5	2016-12-10	2.5.2	Midg12345	Awesome	I love this game I got 2 of my family on it I am hooked I don't really see anything to hate in it!
US	5	2016-12-09	2.5.2	Widener 25	Awesome	Love this game
US	3	2016-12-08	2.5.2	Little mermaid c:	Love it but annoyed	IT KEEPS FREEZING! I wait for minutes and nothing happens. Then I close the app and reopen it, for it to do the same thing over.
US	2	2016-12-07	2.5.2	Dannie.J	Suddenly stopped working	I play this game daily. I played earlier today too and now it freezes as soon as it's done loading. This game refuses to work. You need to fix it. Fun game, but stopped working. I'm on the newest iPhone, the 7 Plus and it's got more than enough space on it, so this problem is on your end, not mine.
US	3	2016-12-07	2.5.2	BeccaMo.	Fun game overall	"I really enjoy playing this game but the ads almost ruin it for me. I often have to close the game and restart it because the screen froze on an ad. If my phone screen doesn't freeze, then somehow when I try to close an ad it takes me to my browser. The video ad for the army is the worst, it takes over the entire screen and pops right back up if I click ""done"" and it just keeps looping. The cost to expand and upgrade is outrageous. Be prepared to be very patient if you don't spend money on the game. The game is a good way to pass the time and take a break from reality."
US	5	2016-12-07	2.5.2	Bunny hop2101😉😀😀😀😜😛	I LOVE THIS GAME	This game is so awesome everything i want is has breeding loving careing and the best part about it is WAR!!!!!!😎😎💥💥😍😘
US	1	2016-12-06	2.5.2	TtRaventt	Ads were far too annoying	"Every time I would try to click on something and uncloseable ad would pop up.
Now I wouldn't mind if it was like every now and then, but every other min was too much."
US	5	2016-12-04	2.5.2	TheDarkestNobody	Awesome and so addicting!!!	This game is amazing!
US	4	2016-12-04	2.5.2	Riam@time	Sooo cool	I like the game I've almost been on it for 360 days but I hate how the food runs out so fast I got a lot of food and I gave one dragon one piece of food the food was at around 36,890 and then it went down to 7,000 so now I wasn't able to feed other dragon to be able to win what I wanted
US	5	2016-12-02	2.5.2	itsjstkay	Fun!	Pretty entertaining/time killer.
US	5	2016-12-01	2.5.2	Lotus River	Very fun!	Addictive, having a great time so far. Only complaint is that the same commercial keeps popping up in the middle of my game. Once in battle. Not good, five for now because I really love it (just got prairie) but annoying commercial needs to at least differ.
US	5	2016-12-01	2.5.2	Mom2JoshNXavier	😀😊😄😁	This game is a lot of fun! I'm enjoying creating the different dragons and leveling them up. The only downside is the ads. They need to go!
US	3	2016-12-01	2.5.2	Lolaloveie	Cute dragons	Cute little game. I'm really into the story so far.
US	5	2016-12-01	2.5.2	Babegirls	Love it except you have to use real Money to leave up your dragons	I love this game. I only have one problem leveling up is so hard you need so much food to level up your dragons it takes forever
US	1	2016-11-29	2.5.2	Megagreninha	Problem	Not letting me buy habitats and it's saying I have 13/13habitats, but I only have like two so I can't place my epic dragon that I got

US	3	2016-11-29	2.5.2	Herpnderp inc	Drachengranny	Love, love, love the game! Plz keep functionality simple for those of us extremely un tech savvy. 😊 you have ruby and emerald. Have u considered sapphire (w h2o ) and/or amethyst (w void) ? ALSO plz keep the expandable function for us, your blind as a bat players. love the  vip dragons. The one touch gold collection from habitats is great. How about a one touch petting button too please. I need more habitats please.  Pretty pretty please habitats!  Thanks. Sincerely,  Granny
US	5	2016-11-27	2.5.2	0'6	I love this Game!	I played war dragons before but this is slightly better! The animation is awesome! And I like how it's a turned based rpg. I've played 2 hours straight silence buying it....
US	1	2016-11-27	2.5.2	MeganG H	Eh, too much time	The timers are way too long, especially with a basic egg for 9hrs. And only one hatchery, unless gems used. The amount of waiting time is ridiculous for early levels and the coin costs jump from something reasonable to something that takes a few days to reach.
US	3	2016-11-27	2.5.2	LegoGirl333 musically	Amazing game!	"I absolutely love this game!❤
I just got to a level 9 and then i bought a water dragon, but when i tried to go feed my water dragon IT TOOK ME OUT OF THE GAME! Please fix this!😭😡"

US	4	2016-11-25	2.5.2	Shasta c	Amazing! But...	"I love this app, but there's also a few things I don't like about it. 

Now, I haven't had this app for to long but from what I have played, it's pretty good. Now here are its ""flaws"".

First of all, I think there's to many ads. I know that you're sponsoring them but srsly tho. Second of all, I don't like when it makes you tap stuff bcuz, most of the time I don't want to. And third of all, sometimes it gets really glitchy and slow, sometimes boot me out of the app. :/

If you could fix those that'd be great! Thanks!"
US	2	2016-11-25	2.5.2	💩😝😘😝💩💕	Just The Advertisements, 😕	This game is amazing overall! I absolutely love it, but what annoys me the most is the random advertisements that show up on your screen without any warning. I understand that you need advertisements which lead to money, and money which keeps the game up and running. But other than that, this game is honestly one of my favorites. ;) Just needs a little improvement is all I'm saying. 😘
US	4	2016-11-25	2.5.2	Llama king👍	Would give it 5 stars but too many ads😬	I like the game to be honest but earlier today I was trying to my dragons and right when I was about to start,an ad comes up and the training session was already starting and I couldn't make progress to my dragons so plz plz consider taking off some ads😅😉
US	1	2016-11-24	2.5.2	Horse Lover MJM	Don't...	Do NOT get. Every time you go in, it will need more data to process, before it was one of my favorite games, but after the clan update, I had to delete it. It is now one of the worst games to become. If you read this, but still get it, you will find I was correct, but it might not happen immeaditly. One more thing, do not join Dragon defenders, that was my clan, but I have reason to believe a hacker is in my clan.
US	5	2016-11-24	2.5.2	KyawYeWont	I Love this game	The best Dragon game ever.  Thanks :* :*
US	5	2016-11-23	2.5.2	Ghana abs	Coolness	This is a great game to play because you get to battle and do all this other stuff and it's pretty cool
US	1	2016-11-23	2.5.2	badapple808	An app for advertising...	Deleting this game. It was fun and all but the ads are frikken ridiculous. Plus, slow to gets coins and clear off an island cost way too much for it to be really fun.
US	4	2016-11-23	2.5.2	Kayla the cupcake	It's an awesome game but....	It's an very addicting and fun and great graphics. But it takes megabits to download dragons and lots of wifi data!! But it's an cool game I love all the elements.🐉🐲
US	5	2016-11-22	2.5.2	Poenny	Fun so far	I'm enjoying it.  But having trouble connecting to facebook.
US	2	2016-11-22	2.5.2	Acquiescek	Ads are obnoxious	Fun game, but ads pop up when you're in the middle of tapping on the screen and often open up the full ad from accidentally clicking on it. The x to close the box often seems to open the full ad instead of closing it as well.
US	3	2016-11-22	2.5.2	Sweetbabi565	Too long	The game is very fun in the beginning. However, it seems that every day I have to download more and more content and the app is getting bigger and bigger. It is really annoying and I already have minimal space on my phone..ill probably delete soon.
US	1	2016-11-21	2.5.2	Taraseeva	Bad customer service	The game is fine to play. Just don't spend any money in it. When something happens and you don't get what you paid for you are out of luck. Customer service is a joke!
US	5	2016-11-21	2.5.2	Mj1169145683	Great	😊

US	1	2016-11-17	2.5.2	Gaming With Infinity	Adds	I know you want to make money but, if you want a 5 star from me you need to make the X buttons bigger. I have to reload the whole game when they pop up please fix them!!!!
US	5	2016-11-15	2.5.2	Pikachu lidrea	CUTENESS	The baby dragons are so CUTE this game is awesome
US	1	2016-11-15	2.5.2	Spottedclaw	About to delete	The ads are super annoying. I never watch the videos for prizes cause I get too many ads while playing. I have to poke the tiny x button a million times for it to close or I poke it and it acts like I poked the ad! Games not even fun anymore, about to delete it forever.
US	4	2016-11-14	2.5.2	Cbruh1234	Awesomeness	I have a really fun time playing this game! But the advertisements are SUPER ANNOYING!!!

US	2	2016-11-12	2.5.2	Saturnmiss	Frustrating	Way to may ads that take u away from the game like ever 30 secs. And I am constantly getting kicked off in the middle of a battle.  You lose your whooping 3 chances to battle for like an hour.  I have won or almost won several times get kicked off with no reward.  Close to getting rid of this game.
US	5	2016-11-12	2.5.2	ParanoidDoll	Finally!	After trying to figure out how to restart this game from the beginning, suddenly it just worked. Don't know what it was I did different, but me happy. Now to finally start from scratch.
US	5	2016-11-11	2.5.2	Ari Silvermouth	Amazing	It definitely is up to par with DragonVale and DragonVale World. I definitely suggest this game to anybody who enjoys playing DragonVale or DVW!
US	5	2016-11-10	2.5.2	Method myrebdbdbdfbs	Great!!!!	I love it great way to pass time and if your bored and have nothing to do well this is a great game to play
US	3	2016-11-10	2.5.2	Dragon_rat	Good, but...	Ok, this is a great game. I can't put it down. But at a certain level (like 15) you should be able to get a 2nd breeding den/hatchery. Otherwise, a great game.
US	4	2016-11-10	2.5.2	Jxststopit	Good	i enjoy this game. and it's easy to understand for younger children.
US	5	2016-11-10	2.5.2	Wolf windfall	Awesome game!	"After a long while of leveling up my dragons, fighting battles, and getting the arena to fight other players, I've become addicted! Although ads are a bit annoying, and leveling up your dragons costs up lots of food and time, it's still a great game. Here are my ideas for the game! 
1: you should be able to trade dragons with other players, you could have a system where you can put a dragon up for trade or sale, and someone can offer you another dragon for it, or pay you for it. 
2: There should be more interactive gameplay. Like having a list of online players requesting to battle. Instead of having the game battle things for other players. 
3. Mini games! There should be mini games you can unlock, that you can play while you wait for dragons to breed, eggs to hatch, ect."
US	3	2016-11-09	2.5.2	Hzinnia	Great but ads get in the way	I love this game but I can't afford to play and the ads really are obnoxious
US	3	2016-11-09	2.5.2	Shdhsbas	Stuck on a level	I'm stuck on level 18, the meter is at 38,192 and its past that and it's still saying I'm on level 18. I love this game I play it everyday throughout the day. If this doesn't get fixed I'm going to be upset and I'll never play it again. Oh and the meter won't even go up even tho I'm still earning XP. Other than that this review would've gotten 5 stars, until this is fixed I will not be updating my review.
US	5	2016-11-09	2.5.2	Brittnikristine	Super cute!	It's cute and fun. A great time killer while also being entertaining.
US	3	2016-11-08	2.5.2	Mayleene	Too many ads	Too many ads popping up when playing
US	2	2016-11-07	2.5.2	PiaV	Fun for a few levels but needs work	"It is definitely fun but too many aspects need improvement to make it a regular game for me. 
* lots of ads. I get it. GL needs to make money but the ads that click through to a website when you try to close them and the data sucking video ads need to go. 
* Special events can't be finished without in-game purchase. These events happen frequently and would cost a small fortune if you play regularly and like to complete challenges. Sure, make them challenging, but impossible isn't fun. 
* After about level 15-20 it takes a very long time to farm enough food and scrolls to level dragons. The dragons stealing my gold mines seem to level faster than I can. So I get stuck frequently now."
US	5	2016-11-06	2.5.2	EnglishMajor86	Fun and easy game	Overall this is a fun and easy game to play, but it does take some time.
US	5	2016-11-06	2.5.2	Goofballlll	Tott	Great game but takes way too long to breed dragons.
US	4	2016-11-06	2.5.2	livyandlattie	Pretty good	A few bugs and everything is pretty expensive game wise (an example would be how many gems you have to spend on skipping a 5 min. thing) but it is a fun game over all.
US	4	2016-11-06	2.5.2	Baevregreyn	Great game but needs fixing!	This game is so much fun and I play it every day but when I went to play it this morning it kept shutting me out. If you can put in an update or something fixing that would be awesome. If you read my review I want to say thanks and please fix this!

US	2	2016-11-02	2.5.2	Linndsey	Too many ads	This game is really fun, and I would give it more stars if it weren't for all the ads. It's really annoying. And if an ad pops up the ability to touch the screen leaves, so if you're in the middle of a training it won't work anymore and your out the coins used to train. Some ads don't even load right.
US	5	2016-11-02	2.5.2	Fantasy213	Awesome	Great game!!!!!!!
US	5	2016-11-02	2.5.2	Shanukski	Love it!!	Very addicting! Favorite game I've ever played.
US	3	2016-10-31	2.5.2	Jess122091	One PROBLEM	I'm really enjoying the game, but I cannot download the 0.00 mb that needs to be downloaded to continue to battle. It says unable to download content. I've done my research online on what to do. I've restarted my internet, no one else is using it, I've restarted my phone, my internet speed is at max, I'm logged into my social media I got the game with and I deleted so much stuff in my phone. I've done it all, and I still can't get it to work.

US	1	2016-10-30	2.5.2	Ehhhhhvcccc	Advertisements Are Consuming My Gameplay!	"Pretty fun little game. But I'm tired of the abundance of ads in my game, like that stupid Barbie ad causes my game to sit on a black screen for like 10 seconds before the ad even loads, then after the ad finishes I try to hit the close button in the corner and I have to hit it a good 20 times before it actually closes, and that is if it doesn't act as if I clicked on the ad, then causing it to take me to my browser in the middle of my game, it's all super annoying.
Also my game just losing signal out of no where in the middle of a match and losing progress. 
I've considered just deleting the app if this continues."
US	2	2016-10-29	2.5.2	Little Shinigami	Many ADS	So annoying too many ads
US	5	2016-10-29	2.5.2	Skoley Bones	Awesome	Good game
US	4	2016-10-29	2.5.2	JKLiott	love it but...	found a few issues. i can't connect to facebook, it never loads so i can get my dragon. another thing is is that it keeps telling me i have to download more content. it gets really irritating after awhile. please fix! otherwise i love the game :)
US	5	2016-10-29	2.5.2	J0HNY_05	A1 since Day 1	My son (who is 5) actually got me hip to this app. He needed help with something and I just had to have it so I've downloaded it and I love it. It's like Pokemon in a way except BETTER. Like I said, I love it and you will too more than likely.
US	1	2016-10-28	2.5.2	MirielKanan	Too many ads	I used to like this game but now there are way too many ads to make it worth playing. Very annoying to go from one screen to another only to be bombarded with one ad after another.
US	5	2016-10-28	2.5.2	Katwoz	The longer you play, the better it gets!	You must have a lot of patience to move along in this game. If you spend money, you definitely can speed it up. That being said, the game is fun, even if you don't spend a cent. It's my favorite for relaxing. It's just charming, and never boring.
US	5	2016-10-28	2.5.2	Renodrft	It's just amazing	Amazing game but need more development keep going
US	5	2016-10-28	2.5.2	Timmychanga	Great game	Lots of fun, though it may drain the wallet a bit. Rather addicting and has super cute dragons!
US	4	2016-10-27	2.5.2	The Great Wyrm	The Great Wyrm	Pretty good game. Best out of all the dragon management games I have tried. The combat system really adds to the game.
US	3	2016-10-27	2.5.2	Gawhuiy	New update	Still getting logged off because of someone trying to log in from another account. Known issue from before the update and it seems like many people had this issue also. Still a decent game though.
US	5	2016-10-27	2.5.2	Nickfer543	frequent crashes	this game crashes every few minutes. constant loss of points with every crash. it is very frustrating.
US	5	2016-10-27	2.5.2	BonjoviGirl74	Fun!	I play this game with my sister who lives two states away!
US	5	2016-10-26	2.5.1	Renebean12323	A.MAZ.ING	This app is fantastic. The dragons are so cute and I play this everyday. One thing I especially love is that you don't start over on the daily rewards when you miss a day!
US	5	2016-10-24	2.5.1	Lordpomkalo	Add me. Code f26809	Add me code f26809
US	2	2016-10-24	2.5.1	Athoma0	Dragon mania legends	Started playing this app like a few people out there. My son downloaded the game and we started playing together to have something to bond over. We both got hooked. He loved coming home from school and finding out what new dragons or islands we had gotten while he was away. It was a blast. Unfortunately I agree with most of the recent reviews. The recent changes and add-ons (enchantments especially) have changed the game in not a very positive way. We don't even try to fight in the enchanted league anymore because there are NEVER dragons even close to our level and I refuse to spend coins to try to find someone to fight with. Also, EVERYTIME I open the app I have to re-download TONS of data. This app takes up more data than all but two other apps on my phone (music and photos) it's insane. Why am I downloading 20-40 mgs if not EVERYTIME I open it at least once everyday? Makes no sense. I've already downloaded it why am I redoing it 100 times more? And of course just like everyone else food is an issue. The amount it takes to level up isn't realistic when you consider the most farms you can have are 12. And to farm enough food to feed the high level dragons it would take at least a few days if not a week to get enough to level up just ONE time. While I understand the game needs to be difficult in order to keep interest, just think it's been taken a little too far. Personally we are no strangers to buying gems, and using those to help out when needed, and we have made it to level 8 vip so far. So I have no issue putting money into a game when I feel like it's worth it. But here lately this game has become more of a pain than a gain. Things aren't different after the next update or two I'm going to have to delete it.
US	2	2016-10-24	2.5.1	Maos	Dragonvale knockoff with WAY too many ads	"I don't mind knock off games if they are fun, but this one seems focused on being as cheap as possible while milking the maximum amount of cash from users. 

It seems like everything is for sale, and not for cheap. Plus, there are ad pop ups that appear and take over the screen. Then there are the ""watch a video"" ads to get you a spin on a wheel which usually results in a minimum amount of food or gold. 

The dragons are cute until you realize that they all have exactly the same animations. And when you note that they are essentially carbon copies of Dragonvale style dragons it gets annoying. Things like 4 foods raises the level, and the amount of food required jumps in the EXACT same increments as in Dragonvale. You breed your dragons in the same manner, and I wouldn't be surprised to learn there is an epic breeding cave or something. But of course, only available for gems (which you have to buy as you get given them in tiny dribs and drabs.

The only novelty is the fighting, but you can only fight like 2-3 battles at a time before you have to recharge or (you guessed it) pay. 

But the ads are where I draw the line. Dragonvale doesn't inundate you with ads. There aren't any in that game, and they do alright. And they have hundreds of dragons each with different animations and actions. There are too many ads for a freemium game. They just make the whole thing annoying."

US	5	2016-10-24	2.5.1	My iPad cv	Hello	I love the game, just PLEASE don't make it so hard to upgrade dragons, I spend a lot of money buying diamonds to buy food...it's getting frustrating and unrealistic thanks

Please fix this issue I've played this game for over a year and love it but I now spend more time having it load in than actually playing."

US	1	2016-10-19	2.5.1	Romanianwolfe	Can't play	Every time I click on the app it closes it. Why can't I play the game anymore. I've tried erasing my history and restarting my iPad but it still closes me out of the game. I don't want to start all over.
US	5	2016-10-19	2.5.1	fancy499	Fun for all ages	Very fun very addictive just can't put it down love it and you can earn special gems easier then any other game I have ever played no need to buy any unless your really in a hurry but you earn so much will never stop playing

US	1	2016-10-15	2.5.1	Chantelczc	Overcharged constantly	I bought gems a few times on my old debit card and realized once I started getting random receipts that I was getting charged for stuff that I didn't want. Nor was I receiving the items in the game that I was bogusly being charged for. I switched debit cards on my apple account last night and haven't even opened my game today and guess what I got a receipt in my email saying I just got a bucket of gems for $10 on my new card...what the crap???? This game is stealing money and I guess hacking my stuff and allowing purchases I never approved!!!
US	1	2016-10-15	2.5.1	Bella0521	Too many Adds	The game is fun.  However, too many adds make you don't wanna play anymore.  Adds every 2 seconds...come on!
US	3	2016-10-15	2.5.1	Aydragon8008	Fix it please	Super fun game to play. Too many ads pop up and game crashes and lags way too much. It always make me download all the contents and it's hard to level up dragons everything is way to expensive.
US	5	2016-10-14	2.5.1	Josiedude_89	Dragon Mania Legends app game	I really, really enjoy my new app game, and just love raising my baby dragons!!! I really, really do love playing and raising my baby pet dragons, leveling them up to battle. This is really quite a great game to play by yourself and a great family-oriented type of game, as well...
US	4	2016-10-14	2.5.1	Jbailey1952	Dragon Mania Legends	Great fun! The new update added many cool new features, but could have been explained a little better. Some of the new features could use some tweaking as it takes forever to get the  trinkets and materials needed to upgrade the breeding den and enchant the parent dragons for the Enchanted Breeding, plus the way the Enchanted League battles work now there's a good chance that you can end up fighting dragons way above your own dragons' levels.
US	5	2016-10-13	2.5.1	Bootz012114	<3	I love this game I've been playing it for a couple years now, I'm even more in love with it now that I'm playing on iOS instead of windows. The only thing is sometimes the game glitches and kicks you out. Game loft should give everyone a couple free portal refill gems especially since they haven't fixed it yet
US	2	2016-10-13	2.5.1	abhaisvkclhd	it used to be fun	I've been playing this game for almost two years but the advertisements now are getting ridiculous. they pop up at the most annoying times and bring you to random websites and it's not as enjoyable. the excessive downloads are getting annoying as well because they take up all the space on my phone. I have no other app that needs to be download every single night. fix some of these changes and the game will be fun again.
US	4	2016-10-13	2.5.1	Iceman17948	Decent game fun to pass time but....	It would be nice to be able to add friends through the game since game center is gone, and the add annoy me but other then that is awesome
US	4	2016-10-13	2.5.1	mattworks	Fun but could easily become expensive.	This game is fun.  But if you you don't want to spend money you will have an unfair advantage  and you can't get any further past a certain point without spending real money!

US	1	2016-10-12	2.5.1	Hugo8686	Customer service is so so bad	I have never written a negative review for my whole life, but this time let me put my first one star review here. because this developer customer service is very very bad. Since I already spent almost $200 on this, please make it works. Some of the features do not work like they said on their website, and for me to able to continue the game, I have to put money in. Customer service never help. Gabriel is terible!!! When I contacted them, they would say:  No, that cannot be done. No, we can do it.... and then when I suft around their forum, I find it myself every time, and it can be done. this time I spent like 2 weeks to talk to them thinking they would resolve it, but no. Then I just wanted them to tell me why the feature does not work, they would not tell me instead of saying thing around... I hope people will not spend money on this, or they will be regret!
US	5	2016-10-12	2.5.1	Zombiegirl8674	Love it	Love the game, love the dragons and it never gets boring for me
US	1	2016-10-12	2.5.1	Jin77	Customer service not there	"The game was fun till they introduced enchantments. Now people who found loopholes in the game have super powerful dragons and the game pairs you up in regular leagues against dragons you'll never be able to beat. They charge money for gems and want you to spend a lot to keep trying find someone you can win against. The game has lost a lot of the fun element and has become a money pit. Customer service is non existent and the company could care less. The game was fun at first and they made a lot of changes over the summer and it's no longer very fun. I use to play daily and I find myself playing less and less because it's more of a PITA then a enjoyment. I have invested money in the game but I am thinking I would do better playing something less of a never ending money hole and who has actually customer support.

Also their new Apple TV app does not even load your game your already playing it makes you start a brand new game. Yes my Game Center is active and synced between all my apple devices."

US	5	2016-10-12	2.5.1	Alexax73	Love it	I started to play this game in August when my son was in vacation and asked me to collect the gold and feed his dragon while he was away. He was level 14 when I took over, and now we are level 63. I became addicted and love it so much. It's fun enjoyable hard but it keep you constantly busy in doing something. GL customer service was able to resolve my issue when the account was completely lost and restarted from zero from my ipad and they fix it in just 2 days.  I only wish it was easier to get food. Those dragons eat a lot!!!
US	5	2016-10-12	2.5.1	Lerako55	I like dargons	Gamelofr's a pretty good company. And this game isn't too addicting, easy and fun. Dragons rule.

US	4	2016-10-12	2.5.1	A. Chaj	Cool👌	So it's a pretty good game accept that most eggs, all eggs take like 3 or 12hours to hatch and building also take 3 hours. So please fix that thank you. Other than that it's a really fun good game. Oh and battling can get really hard all of the sudden. And if you don't buy the starter pack, it's gonna be pretty rough in the beginning.
US	1	2016-10-12	2.5.1	Constructive Criticism Gal	WHY???	I have been playing this game for a long time now because it's super fun. I have worked so hard on it to earn rare dragons, but after the update, most of my dragons got deleted for some strange reason, and now the only way to get it back is to download extra data from the game!? WHY?! 😫😭 Please explain! I have worked so hard on the game a and want them back but can't get them back cause my iPad storage is low! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!! 😫😭😭😭

using my progress. Ie: in dungeon battle. Almost won....restarts....come back....my battle needs to start again YET I STILL lost a life. Only way to regain life....buy it with real money.
Eats up memory like sand in an hourglass. Shady to say the least!"
US	4	2016-10-11	2.5.1	ChevyLover95	DragonML	This game is amazing but the food costs are outrageous and it takes so much to feed the dragons. It is also impossible to collect.

Though, every single time I open the app I always seem to get these dragons that have question marks on them. I press download all every single time. Then, I can't anymore because the app has wasted my storage. May you fix this? I have good wifi, good data, good everything. But these ""question mark dragons"" are getting in my way. And another thing, question mark buildings. I've had enough of these question mark things! I'll keep the app till you fix this. Otherwise, a good app. I suggest to download."
US	4	2016-10-11	2.5.1	Balekdeh bale dryer	I like it right now	I've written 2 reviews but they got deleted because I had an invalid nickname.  Basically: the game is mostly rewarding to those willing to spend 50+ dollars on gems that may not even work.  It's fun for now.  I'll probably eventually get bored of trying to win event dragons and realizing that I don't have a chance because I'm not choosing to spend money.  Fighting gets kind of old.  The further along you get the more time it takes (getting food and leveling up your dragons) and it gets frustrating.  It's fun for now though.
US	4	2016-10-11	2.5.1	Zyra02	Was I hacked??!	Ok I was playing my game collecting items for the event and when I was collecting the crabs/creatures. The background is black and I get a notification that says that my log in has been disconnected from another device. I have no other device that has this game besides my phone. I got a little paranoid now and was looking around to see if anything changed. When I went to my fortress that has the big egg, it doesn't show my teams icon and name under it. What's written now are wwwwwwwwwwwwwww, but it's off to the side over top of the lighthouse. I hope it was just a bug and nobody trying to hack my game. If it was someone trying that maybe you should increase your security, but if it's a bug please fix it!!
US	2	2016-10-11	2.5.1	Rosnick v	Lot of ads every minute	The advertising pop up every minute look like the computer virus.
US	4	2016-10-11	2.4.0	User109203	The game is almost unplayable with ads	After a certain amount of time invested the ads go away and reveal a fantastic game. Could use more character animation and effects.

US	1	2016-10-05	2.4.0	Don121	Blocked For Nothing	I'm addicted to this game but when Gameloft blocks you from playing for supposedly cheating and will not respond to the support ticket or corresponding emails to the issue it makes you feel like none of the players are worth Gameloft's time, so that is why they get only 1 star. If it were not for the horrible customer care support the game would have been given 5 ⭐️. Note to future players, don't play with a slow wifi connection or not play for almost a year after starting the game or you could be blocked as I have been

US	3	2016-10-01	2.4.0	Candicelouise	Very addicting but needs some improvements!	"I really enjoy playing this game, it's rather addicting, and I would score it a 5 if the issues mentioned below could be addressed. It is a lot of fun but I might stop playing if my advancement in the game keeps being hindered by these very easily fixed and reasonable requests have been dealt with. 
------
I have been playing this game for a few months and really enjoy taking care of my herd of dragons and it's always fun to complete challenges and do quests. That being said, there are a few issues I have with the game that I think the app creators should consider fixing because I can't be the only one who struggles with these issues:

1- If you don't have friends who play the app on Facebook, it seems that there is no other way to add ""friends"" on the game, which means you are limited in what you can do in the game because you are excluded from anything that requires friends. It will show you people allegedly near you and will even let you go look at other people's islands (although there doesn't seem to be anything you can DO while visiting) but there is just no way to add any of these people. This also makes forming and maintaining a clan very difficult. I spent MONTHS trying to get accepted into a clan before breaking and paying to create my own and I've yet to manage to add any other people to my clan so doing clan quests is basically pointless with only one participant. 

2- There needs to be an alternative way to generate the coins or earn VIP apart from having to pay real money (and yes, I've watched probably hundreds or more of those spin the wheel ads and I more often than not end up with a small amount of good or food). I understand that is how the game makes money but most events are impossible to place well in without VIP and a lot of the upgrades require a number of gems that one can only achieve through purchasing or weeks or months of gem boarding. In order to advance in the game and keep up with tasks and events, it would nice if there were other ways to earn VIP and gems. 

3- I've actually been known to spend real money on games like these in the past but the amount of cash this app expects people to pay for VIP, extra gems or food, or any of those bundles that are always on ""sale"" is LITERALLY INSANE. I'm willing to spend like $1-$5, MAYBE even $10 on an app game from time to time (especially for things like VIP and reasonable food packages to help grow my dragons quicker) but a lot of these packages and individual items are more like $20+, going as high as $100, which is OUTRAGEOUS. And the contents of the bundles are NEVER justifiable for that sort of price, which is why I think they are constantly ""on sale"" for similarly ridiculous prices. Considering this game seems to be geared at children, although many adults like myself play them, it seems downright bizarre that you would have such exorbitant prices for app purchases."
US	5	2016-09-30	2.4.0	Kayla Marcia	IN LOVE	"I tried out this game thinking it could be something to do when I'm terribly bored, but I automatically got addicted. I love how there's so much to do. A lot of people think the prices are unfair and I understand that. But the game really does give tons of opportunities to gain gems, coins, and food. There's ""Otto's Spin"" where you can literally spin up to 10 times and earn all the above. There's also awards for doing certain tasks. Of course, while spending money would allow anyone to progress ten times faster, just know the game is definitely not making that to be the only option to enjoy the game overall. I love this game... too much. I'm 20 years old. Someone help."
US	5	2016-09-29	2.4.0	Anrecd	Fun, challenging	Game is more interactive than others that I play.  You actually have to manually participate in the attacks and use sound strategy for victories.  Having fun with it.
US	2	2016-09-28	2.4.0	lxlPyrolxl	Game is ok but....	The constant ads that pop up are extremely frustrating. There's a severe shortage of gold to be had and the limit of 3 attack energy at a time is just crippling
US	4	2016-09-28	2.4.0	KaitieFletcher	Extremely fun but....	I love this game and it's very addicting but it's very hard to level up dragons unless you spend a ton of money and time growing food. We should be able to level up our dragons through experience in battles as well.
US	5	2016-09-27	2.4.0	MC V	Love this Game!!	I love this game though I think you should be able to call off your breeding, if you know what I mean?Like in the breeding cave there should be a button to call off your breeding but you won't get your egg! Sounds like a good idea to me!!!
US	4	2016-09-27	2.4.0	KhimiC	My roommates made me play	Save me
US	5	2016-09-27	2.4.0	CynthiaAvey	Love It But Need To Fix Crashing	I have a very excellent new iPad Air 2 and 75 Mbps cable internet, but sometimes when opening the app it won't open just disappears out of sight why? Fix it please today, tired of having to reinstall it then have to download all those updates in game. Fix it.
US	5	2016-09-26	2.4.0	Jillycat101	PLEASE READ (this is positive)	"This game is so addicting and I love the dragons. I am very happy that I got that unicorn dragon last night!(🦄🐲) The Browns game was on so that's probably how I got it. ANYWAYS, I love the game but when I told my friend about the dragon she said congrats and told me she her App Store wasn't working so she couldn't update it therefore she couldn't get on. Sadly, she deleted the game🙁. As I was looking at other reviews, I noticed I a lot of them were about adds popping up. You might want to get that fixed. I wish it didn't require wifi. That is to all dragon ml lovers.Thanks!
Jillycat101🙂

PS I think that I put in the most emojis in one review.hehe😀😀😀"
US	4	2016-09-26	2.4.0	singa2n	Improvements made.	"The ads have gotten better but there still isn't much diversity but they still open up at unfortunate times, sometimes in rapid succession.

Overall, except for the menthol if times required to progress through the game, the instructions and challenges in the side bar are helpful, except for the number of tries you have to make before getting a specific egg.  There are some decent web helps if you search for specific pairings, but even then it's a bit hit or miss for a while when breeding.  Mercury took me forever and I still have no luck with Getting a Cyborg dragon."
US	4	2016-09-25	2.4.0	Artistboy636	Pretty Fun😄	This game is actually fun most dragon games are so boring I delete them right away. The only thing I don't like is the ads. Especially the one with the Kraft cheese its Spanish I cant understand it but this hang is pretty fun and addicting.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
US	5	2016-09-25	2.4.0	Awesome girly girl 200	Amazing game	This game has amazing features and you can even breed them and make very cute little dragons it is so nice and fun to play so o suggest that you get the app and its for free
US	4	2016-09-24	2.4.0	SieSieSlash	Really fun but...	This game is great . I like it a lot .But the only thing that's bugging me is that you have to pay for your membership and in order to keep your membership you have to buy 💎 packs and it's very hard. This game is very amusing and addicting but I hope they make some little changes so this game has a little boost 🙂
US	5	2016-09-24	2.4.0	Alliecat123 82	Fun!	I totally recommend it!!!!!!!
US	3	2016-09-24	2.4.0	Dragon protector 26	Game experience and overall opinion	I've had this game since September.Love all but 2 things about the game.Hardness of earning gems and cost to clear obstacles!Both are ridiculous.If I am expected to have to buy gems.Let me use the easy to earn coins!The cost is outrageous when you think of how needed the gems are!!!
US	5	2016-09-24	2.4.0	Nintendo131	Great game	Good game here. Use this code 1a9d34 in the lighthouse for a better start.

US	4	2016-09-23	2.4.0	Beanlie	Ads	Honestly I love this game and would have given it 5 stars. But the amount of ads is quite ridiculous. They are also way too sensitive and take you out of the game constantly. If you fix this problem it would make a lot of people happy.
US	5	2016-09-23	2.4.0	Mathewsdariotomat@gmail.com	Nostalgia	I used to love this game, and played it all the time, along with Jurassic world, but then SOME IMBECILE STOLE MY PHONE AND I LOST EVERYTHING
US	3	2016-09-22	2.4.0	RainbowDashIsMehBae	Disappointed	Some times when I click on the app it quickly closes it .-. Please fix that
US	1	2016-09-21	2.4.0	Lindz05092009	Too many ads!!!	The ads take away from the game experience. Would be fun if I don't have to clear an add every 2 min. One will spend more time on the ads then they will playing a game. I have better things to do!
US	3	2016-09-20	2.4.0	Squirrel boi	Great game	The game is great but ive been having some issues where it crashes. I had to redownload the app because it would crash right after the intro music would start playing on the loading screen. Got that jssue resolved sort of. And now i cant tap ANY of the icons for storage, market, even events without the game crashing. Please look into this? Otherwise ive enjoyed the game up to this point with the crashing issues.
US	2	2016-09-20	2.4.0	Deltanight	Pop ads	The purpose of the game is make money but the intrusive pop up ads really ruin this one. Why would I purchase anything when clearly they are making money selling ad space.  I won't pay for something that is going to annoy.
US	5	2016-09-19	2.4.0	DaViiiper	Fan of this game	This game is so good I love. I play it every day of my life good game guy who makes this game.

US	5	2016-09-18	2.4.0	Emojiforlife	Best game ever	I am obsessed with this game. Dragon mania legends sponsered glitter forever 17 and she said it was super fun and addictive and she was right. I started playing about 5 months ago and I don't play any other games now.
US	5	2016-09-18	2.4.0	Dovahkiin940	One of the best!	This game is the best game ever! It has PvP (once you get to a certain lvl), a way to earn things that require real money to get, a good story and a great fighting system.
US	5	2016-09-18	2.4.0	loving series	Fun if not for all pop-ups, spyware and ads.	It would be more fun if not for all the annoying pop-ups, spyware, and ads. I especially do not like games that promote drinking. When I want to play games, I do not enjoy clicking on a dragon, and a pop-up ad appearing instead of where I clicked. It takes me away from the game and opens many browsers. I blocked pop-ups but, this game found a way around these blocks. If I happen to be logged on to Amazon, sometimes these annoying ads create a browsing history, and Amazon starts to advertise based on browsing history, and this game has even been able to place things in my shopping cart. I had to turn off one-click purchases, as a result. When I play games, I do not like being tricked into clicking open pop-ups, ads, or games that create spyware. It happens almost each 60 seconds. It is not occasionally.  I also notified the developers about this. I did not get a response, and the ads still continue to the point I cannot enjoy the game because of all the pop-ups getting in the way of my gaming experience.
US	5	2016-09-18	2.4.0	Dragons lava	AWSOME GAME!!!!!!!!!	Amazing and awesome game in my life!when I started to play I just play and play!who ever this creator is is amazing!
US	4	2016-09-18	2.4.0	SuperCuddlyWolf	GREAT (almost)🤗	I think that this game is amazing but you should add a little something. Maybe once your at a certain level, you can customize your own dragon 🐉.
US	2	2016-09-18	2.4.0	KristinaH66	2 stars due to prices and costs	Great game and fun to play, a lot of opportunities for rewards! However, the prices and costs of gems for how many you get is ridiculous! Especially since you needs gems to up your VIP stat, to get gold or anything else. Up the amount of gems and lower the cost! And give more chance to win gems and give more gems as rewards! Plus the chart that shows what hits are strong and weak is incorrect! It shows water is a strong hit against earth, yet in game water is shown as weak hit! This needs to be fixed!

US	4	2016-09-16	2.4.0	Andygirl1031	Fun, but Ads every two minutes	I love this game, but it gets extremely frustrating when I'm playing when an ad pops up and takes me out of the game. They only come when I am trying to get something. So annoying. I'm a patient person, but when this happens every two to five minutes, it gets old really fast. Fix how the ads pop up please!

US	2	2016-09-08	2.4.0	Costons	Meh	This game looked fun, has a lot of promise, but it relies way too much on using gems to get further than about 10 minutes into the game. And ads pop up about every 30 seconds, which was also extremely annoying. I get it, the devs need to earn a living, but the balance is too far off.
US	4	2016-09-08	2.4.0	Queen_of_Ireland	Very addicting but.....	I've only been playing this game a few days and I already love it. Lots of variety and things to accomplish and do. A few suggestions though, 1. Once an egg is finished and ready to be hatched if I already have an egg in the hatchery I should be able to move the new egg to my inventory until I'm able to hatch it, 2. Some of the challenges need to be a bit more realistic with the time frame. Not everyone can or will spend money. Challenge we should be able to be met without spending money, however it can definitely be done quicker if you spend money and 3. Some of the upgrades should be able to be purchased with coins as well not just gems. I cannot upgrade my hatchery because it requires 150 gems with no option to upgrade with coins. Other than those small things I really love this game.
US	5	2016-09-08	2.4.0	Stalker8537	Fun game	Good game lots of fun but wish they would make the events lvl based I'm lvl 22 and there's no way I'm going to get first when I have to play people lvl 50 + it makes it not worth playing events

Over All I Love and Enjoy The Whole App/Game and Would Highly Recommend It To Anyone Who Loves Apps/Games Like Dragon ML and To Anyone Who Just Love Dragons Period.

I like how you go into battles and progress through the levels of the battles. The graphics are nice. I appreciate having a friend on the game to help me get energy or to use his dragons. I enjoy the way the dragons have a ""happy dance"" everytime we win a battle. I enjoy the farm but I do not like waiting and waiting for the farms to upgrade. Im very patient and it is very long for me. I understand its to make the person playing come back but do some things need to take hours?"
US	3	2016-09-07	2.4.0	Juelou	To much	Really enjoy the game, but gems, etc... Cost to much, takes to long to breed, and hatch,

US	5	2016-09-07	2.4.0	Katrhotwings	Old Tina	Love this game. Lots to do everyday on it. It's always updating and giving new tasks and goals. Love it. Been playing it for over a year daily.

US	5	2016-09-07	2.4.0	Porsche21	Fun game	A great game and fun to play, they should make some of the dragons cheaper or easier to get. Exchanging coins for gems would be great.

US	5	2016-09-06	2.4.0	BukowsKERALashes	A family game...	For a year and a few months now, my son and daughter, who are respectively nine years old and eleven and a half years old currently, have been playing this game. We share a gaming ID, and we all have different times that are designated to do something relaxing or free time for a game. All three of us, mom and two kids, we play this and help each other and really enjoy it. If someone is too busy to play, a family member takes over and we progress faster. This is appropriate for kids and for adults and a way to use technology less, but still use it in a fun way.
US	5	2016-09-06	2.4.0	SoursugerW	Great game	I absolutely love this game! Best dragon game I've played thus far!
US	3	2016-09-06	2.4.0	BlueThunderWolf	Pretty good.	Pretty great game, the pop up adds get on my nerves but what can you do-
US	5	2016-09-06	2.4.0	PokeShuffleXpert	Best dragon game out there. Period.	"I love Dragon Mania Legends. My favorite app. Unlike other dragon-breeding games, you don't reach a point where you're stuck if you don't continuously spend money. However, spending a little money doesn't hurt, (and depending on what you're buying, it can be worth it.) Personally, the only things that are truly ""worth it"", are half-off sales on the Daily Clam, and the Dragon Lord Bundle (only because it's the only way to get the legendary Planet Dragon). But, that doesn't not mean there aren't other purchases that might be worth it; buying gems can upgrade a VIP status, which can enhance gameplay. 3-on-3 dragon battles are fun. Feed dragons to make them level up, and make them stronger. Each dragon has their own elements, and you can train these elements for exclusive effects. There are five rarity levels: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Breeding dragons is my favorite part of the game. Put two dragon into the breeding den to get a random dragon, (depending on what elements the parent dragons pass on to the baby.) Dragon Of The Week weekly events allow you to breed a limited-time dragon, and Dragon Of The Month events allow you to breed limited-time Legendary dragons. (Week, Month, and Enchanted Breeding dragons don't necessarily follow normal breeding rules.) Depending on your VIP level, you can breed exclusive dragons. Dragons can only go in habitats that match one of their elements, and Legendary dragons can only go in a Legendary, (X-mas, or Time) habitat, which can house any dragon. Boss dragon have their own exclusive habitat. You can battle the Vikings in the Outer Isles to take back Dragolandia! You can also participate in Otto's Clockwork Dungeon (which resets daily,) to win prizes such as coins, food, and Dungeon Tokens to spend at the Dungeon Shop. There is also a chance to win the Dragon Of The Day. You can join or create a clan. Enchant dragons when they reach level 16 to participate in Enchantment League battles and enchanted breedings for exclusive dragons. On top of that, you can watch short ads to win gift chests with enchantment pieces (which are used to enchant dragons,) and spin a wheel for big prizes. Dragon Mania Legends is a free download, so what are you waiting for? There's more to learn and more fun to be had, so play today!"
US	5	2016-09-06	2.4.0	WarnerBONG	FUN	I like this game because it gives me something to do when I'm bored and it is really fun because I usually do these kinds of games right after I get them
US	5	2016-09-06	2.4.0	NavyRuby11💎	My favs dragon game	I love this game so much👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
US	3	2016-09-06	2.4.0	LiDDLETEE 💟	TOO MANY ADS!!!!!!!	This is a mixed review because I LOVE THIS GAME! Been playing it for over a year now. But for the past 6 months or so , literally every 10 seconds either an AD or AD video pop up. I always accidentally click it because there is no warning , and it opens the Internet. So I then have to close it out and reopen the game. EXTREMELY ANNOYING! Please get rid of the ad pop ups!
US	5	2016-09-06	2.4.0	adel almusawi aldneinawe	Iraq	good
US	4	2016-09-06	2.4.0	medstudnt	Great but...	This game is a lot of fun. I love all the different dragons you can create. The only struggle is how hard it is to level up your dragons because it's so hard to get food. I'm worried I might get bored before I level my dragons up to 30 even!
US	5	2016-09-06	2.4.0	gymnastgril53799754	Awesome	I love the game there is nothing wrong with it I highly recommend it .😀😀😀
US	3	2016-09-06	2.4.0	LucianKing08	Very addictive game.	This a very addictive game and love playing it. My only complaint is that I wish that you guys weren't trying to make people spend money. The goals and the time limits for food is unrealistic unless you spend money. 12 hours for 1500 food. But to reach a top prize in 2-3 days you have to spend money. If the goals were more realistic and the time for food was a lot better I would give it 5 stars.
US	4	2016-09-06	2.4.0	ma7314	Game is fun but the ads are too sensitive	Love playing this game. There's so many different things to do and they are always running special events. My only complaint is when ads pop up they take you out of the game if you happen to touch ch the screen at that very moment. It's so sensitive it happens constantly. I wish the programmers would led put a slight delay in activating the ad link.
US	3	2016-09-06	2.4.0	Magoalie	So many adds	I have to admit I do enjoy the battles and creating strong dragons but the amount of pop up adds is a little rediculous and super annoying. I would play the game more if adds were for rewards and didn't pop up every 2 minutes
US	4	2016-09-05	2.3.2	NitroNico46	Just to let you know😝	The game is good but the ads man the ads
US	5	2016-09-05	2.3.2	DerpTDM	Awsome	This is a Awsome game I love it!!!
US	4	2016-09-04	2.3.2	MrSirSheep	Nice	It is the best dragon game that was made. The other dragon games is ok but this game is nice.
US	5	2016-09-04	2.3.2	Me~6	Amazing😍	I've played this game so many times and I still cant get enough of it. 👌🏻👌🏻
US	1	2016-09-04	2.3.2	aet15	ADS	This is a great game, great concept, pretty much great everything, except the ads actually make it hard to play. There's been a number of times I've just stopped playing because I feel like I can't do anything due to the amount of ads. I want to keep this game but at this point it's really just not worth it.
US	1	2016-09-04	2.3.2	mblakeley42240	Worst game ever money hungry	Be warned parents this is a money hungry game and unfair advantages if you don't spend real cash!
US	5	2016-09-03	2.3.2	JaTsWoG	ADDICTING	I love the game! I've been playing for 4 hours!
US	4	2016-09-03	2.3.2	S23janelle	Dragon game review	My mom and I really enjoy this game. But I didnt like when you added those star things. I honestly dont get it and I feel like it just complicated the game more. It was hard enough making their elements stronger. Also, just an idea... Maybe you can do something so we can trade dragons with other players? That would be awesome!
US	2	2016-09-03	2.3.2	Nkbje	As I more	Nice game but the ads really turn me off
US	5	2016-09-02	2.3.2	Fermaldahyde	I love this game	You should get this.  Great time crusher!!!!!!
US	5	2016-09-01	2.3.2	Vipr Hitz	Love this app so much 😚	You guys spent so much time but it was so worth it you make me happy I love this app you are awesome
US	5	2016-09-01	2.3.2	Bobbineye	Cheats	I've been playing this game for a short time now and it ticks me off royal when I read how they will band someone for cheating!!  Well, they need to start with themselves.  Almost every other time I spin the wheel for a chance to win gems, i get cheated. Just now it clearly landed on 10 gems and what did I get?? 650 in food. No gems!  Just food!  And that's certainly not the first time this has happened. I have yet to get more than 1 gem, ever from these spins.
US	4	2016-08-31	2.3.2	Adairbears	Fun but super annoying ads	Beautiful graphics, fun play, addicting build up...super annoying ads. Decrease them and more people will play.
US	3	2016-08-31	2.3.2	Sbitter2012	Fun but too many ads	There is sometimes as much play time as ad time. Fun otherwise.
US	4	2016-08-31	2.3.2	Imdanoob	Love it	I love the game and i love the models and all that stuff all dragon games have their own aspect of how dragons would look and i like that a lot of ads and that kinda ruins the game so it's a good idea to cut down on the ads enough to where you don't have half the reviews about the ads but its the best running 3D model game with good looking dragons that don't look too bad little bits and pieces here and there but other than ads and graphics i LOVE it
US	4	2016-08-31	2.3.2	GrimReaper1327	Ads	Good game just need less ads and by less I mean none.
US	5	2016-08-31	2.3.2	Mania legends	So awesome	So cool it's the best game ever
US	2	2016-08-31	2.3.2	Hbomb4578905783846252	Boo	Great game, except for the ads. Get rid of the constant ads popping up and your game will be 100% better
US	5	2016-08-30	2.3.2	01 Dr. Who fan	So cute!	This app is really fun and can be addictive rather quickly. My only complaint is the full scree ads that pop up without notice, usually when I'm in the middle of tapping something😒. Other than that, I love it!!
US	3	2016-08-30	2.3.2	Jkgddav	Dragons!! And Ads...?	Game was intriguing, i liked the dragon battles, elemental system that was incorporated, all the extra islands and what not made it feel like clash of clans and dragons had a baby except...the ads..the ads were terrible. One thing if theyre on the side, which is immensely annoying, or u can watch one for gems or gold but these ads will disrupt your gameplay by sporadically appearing and taking over your screen. Another issue i had was when minimizing the game will require you to reload into the world again when u maximize it. What..? The dragon i just hatched is in an egg again because i went to answer a text then went back to the game. Games cool if u can deal with these problems. I couldnt.
US	5	2016-08-30	2.3.2	lerOK95no	My lovely	My the most favorite game!
US	3	2016-08-29	2.3.2	Fjdbrbxkjsdj	😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡	ADS. SO. MANY. ADS. NO MORE ADS PLZ OR I WILL DELETE APP AND I WILL NEVER GET A GAMELOFT APP AGAIN U GREEDY DEVS.
US	4	2016-08-28	2.3.2	Mommy2jhhb	Fun game but....	I play the game with my kids.  It's fun,  But the ads are overwhelming.  We have been in the middle of training our dragons and an ad will pop up and then you lose and you are out your coins.
US	5	2016-08-28	2.3.2	Kaboom4245	This game rocks	Very fun and entertaining
US	4	2016-08-28	2.3.2	Naextraordinary	Fun game, too many ads	The dragons are cute, quests are easy, lots to do! 🐲💜
US	5	2016-08-28	2.3.2	DragonManiac1234	Awesome game!	This game is a must have for any dragon lover! The graphics are great, the designs are creative, the battling is fun, and each and every dragon is lovable! This is the best dragon raising game you can get so far, but it still has it's flaws. Every 1-3 minutes an ad comes up and you have to wait to skip it. And that's about it!
US	4	2016-08-28	2.3.2	Aceosaurus	Attractive l, but to many ads	The amount of content is amazing, even though most dragons share the same body design they all fight very differently. The ads are a bit of a headache though, I find my self clicking out of ads instead of playing the actual game. If you can limit the ads to the roulette wheel, that would be great.
US	5	2016-08-28	2.3.2	EstephanieMo	👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽	Addicted!!

US	5	2016-08-25	2.3.2	Baffled in Boston	Explicit content??!	My 7 year old has played this game for a year or so, and now it has been blocked from her iPad because we have Explicit Content restrictions?  While it's listed as 12+, this game looks appropriate for 5+. Please fix this ridiculous exclusion for a KID's game.
US	5	2016-08-25	2.3.2	akjacefinch	Back and still cool	Stopped for awhile but couldn't stay away
US	3	2016-08-25	2.3.2	Nalsaleh	Feedback..	The game needs to be updated soon. It's very glitchy and sometimes doesn't even load. Also, too many ads are shown disrupting the enjoyment of the game. Also, you sometimes even feel pressured to buy crystals because reaching a certain high number of crystals (which is sometimes required for certain item in the game like upgrading the hatchery) by playing the game regularly is almost impossible.
US	2	2016-08-25	2.3.2	Bat devot	Crashing	"The app is crashing on lunch every time I open it it will crash. 
I try restarting my device it still crashes Canyon fix it please"
US	1	2016-08-24	2.3.2	Sage222003	Game Broken - Do NOT Download	So I downloaded this game because I'm a fan of most of the developers game. Once I got into the swing of things after level 5, I received a pay to get some bonus features. I figured it was a good deal, I might as well pay cash because it was entertaining. Once I get to level 8, the game says I need to Download additional data to proceed. NOPE. the game is broken and I can't download the data needed to proceed any further. The money I spent in the game expired after a week and I wasn't able to reap any of he benefits after spending real cash. Do not, I repeat do not download this game or spend any money. They will rip you off. Wait until the patch up the game. Until then, it's worthless.
US	5	2016-08-24	2.3.2	Eliah Storm	Frigging cute	Omg it's frigging cute. YOU CAN PET THE DRAGONS!!!!!!

US	2	2016-08-24	2.3.2	Dragon Mom16	Bugs in Dragon Mania	My boys loved playing this game but then it stopped working on WiFi - multiple devices, multiple players, all having the same issue. I don't let them play using data / personal hot spots so now they aren't playing so we will probably just delete the app to stop disappointing our kids. Fix your bugs, Dragon Mania!!!
US	3	2016-08-24	2.3.2	#imastegosaurus	Apple told me this	APPLE TOLD ME THAT THIS GAME IS JACKING UP PEOPLES PHONES! And I love this game so much! It is so disappointing! So Gameloft please fix the bugs in here. Oh also so much ads that is so flipping annoying! And it takes too long to load Sorry for the news but it's true. (Anyway get it it's awesome except the disappointments I listed)

US	1	2016-08-22	2.3.2	JQBean	Kill the game with ads	Game has some fun elements, and great graphics.  Would be fun to play except for the full screen ads that pop up every minute or two, including some ads that force you to watch a full video.  As with other users, I end up tapping on an ad just because they just suddenly appear so frequently.  Have to reload the game way to often because of that.  Just a shame that something that could be fun is ruined by forcing these ads at the players.
US	4	2016-08-22	2.3.2	Jack the path	Events...	I really enjoy playing this game. In fact, I enjoy all aspects EXCEPT the events. The events are a nice concept, but they need tweaking. There is no way to finish them before they end, UNLESS you buy whatever is needed.
US	3	2016-08-22	2.3.2	Hupomene76	Great game with one major flaw	I have enjoyed this game greatly. It is entertaining and engaging, love the constant challenges. What is driving me to play less are the constant server disconnects. I have a very fast and reliable network, and am always streaming to my television, so I do not believe this is coming from my end. Having to re do game play is becoming frustrating, as it happens 4-6 times a day. I am currently recovering from back surgery so my entertainment options are limited. Would love to see this fixed so I can spend more time and money advancing.
US	5	2016-08-22	2.3.2	MissMonkey🐒	PLEASE READ THIS	So I haven't played the game yet, but I had read most of the reviews. Tons are really good ratings however I see the issue is with the ads. So if you play this game, and you are reading this what you can do is turn on airplane mode!! ☺️☺️ Hoped that helps you.
US	4	2016-08-21	2.3.2	Takeoff FAILURE	Great Dragons! Stupid Ads!	Yes. I love this game because the dragons are 3D and they are not cheesy or evil. However, one major problem. The same ADS just keep POPPING UP and taking me to some STUPID AD SITE and then i have to EXIT OUT and reload the game. The person who recently said gameloft is a greedy evil scheming company is a bunch of baloney but he or she had a point. END THE ADS!!! IF YOU HATE THE ADS PUT IT IN THE REVIEW 😡🙂😄😠😀

US	3	2016-08-20	2.3.2	Abevbbdjxi	Too many ads	The game is fun but a ad pops up about every 1 to 2 minutes. Then when I accidentally click on it, it brings me to a whole different web page that I don't care about.
US	5	2016-08-20	2.3.2	John Liverman	Fun game and not violate	It's nice it entertains me not to many ads yet.and it's not violent 😊 . It's very addictive I'll give it a 👍🏻👍🏻

US	3	2016-08-18	2.3.2	Allison delauder	One Issue	This is a great game, I honestly think it's better than Dragon Story, but I don't like the constant ads, having only a few is okay, but the amount of ads that you guys put on there is ridiculous. I know your just trying to make money, but that's what the in app purchases are for.

US	4	2016-08-17	2.3.2	Lizrude	What is with the ads??	So my 4 year old loves this game. He loves the dragons. I let him play with my phone so he can take care of them. What I don't like, is a video ad for Miller Lite playing! I don't know how that is even possible. Obviously not every person who plays this game is over 21. And if he clicked something saying he was...he can't read! And was probably just trying to make the screen go away. Make this ad go away. I am not happy about it.
US	3	2016-08-17	2.3.2	TheORIGINALFlvor	Too many updates, good game	This game is a fun past time, however I would prefer if there were less updates. It's too much at one time
US	1	2016-08-17	2.3.2	Hlalakar	Tragic waste	This game has the potential to be great, but the vast number of pop up ads make it almost unplayable. They pop up all the time without rhyme or reason and totally interrupt game play. There is no reason for this sine the game is also supported by a freemium model and has voluntary ads that win you a small prize after you watch them. The game makers got way too greedy and I hope they change it.
US	5	2016-08-17	2.3.2	Deer dragon	Really addicting	Kinda like chugging pure sugar.

US	4	2016-08-16	2.3.2	Strudelhouse	Just started	"I just started last night, and the only negative I've seen yet, is the constant ad popping up for soundcloud. It's like every 30 seconds.

Turning off notifications got me 2 ads.

Jeez, lighten up with the 'in your face' ads."
US	4	2016-08-16	2.3.2	Smrizor	AD Free Verison	I have been playing this game for awhile and my only major gripe is the ads. It would be nice to have a purchase option where you wouldn't have to deal with the ads.

US	3	2016-08-16	2.3.2	Chuackster	Dragoneer	"Fun enough game but I feel like I have to battle the adds more than the dragons. 

Cut back on the intrusive adds. Your in the middle feeding a dragon one second. Then next you know your being directed to a webpage because an add popped up."
US	3	2016-08-16	2.3.2	MamaHazlett	Love the game but there are way way to many pop up advertisements	If there is anyway you could cut back on the pop up advertisements this game would one of the best! Also if you could up grade the hatchery with coins or something besides jewels! I know you want money but you can get it with out making us have to use our jewels to upgrade certain things! Please consider my opinion I am 100% sure I ain't the only that feels this way! Thank you and have a blessed life🙏
US	5	2016-08-16	2.3.2	Haleighhbee	Favorite	This is my favorite game
US	4	2016-08-16	2.3.1	VirgoNation	TO MANY ADS.	It's a really addicting and fun game in which I suggest however you only get 3 lives and they always have ads popping up and so you accidentally click on them and then it takes you away from the game. Overall it is a good game but these ads need to be cut down seriously!!!!!!
US	5	2016-08-16	2.2.0	Bethanym09	Great time waster :)	Relatively easy and the dragons are super neat. A+
US	5	2016-08-15	2.3.2	D3shm	Is very very nice is good	I have a good one for me
US	1	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Another mick	Kinda bummed.	Just did the update and now it won't load. Just keeps closing the app.
US	5	2016-08-15	2.3.2	FTP yo	Love at first sight	I love this app so much it is really fun and I love the theme song I'm upsets
US	2	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Psychomom3168	Was great until update!	App was working great until I downloaded the update. Now it won't even open.
US	1	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Upsetauntie	Updated broke the game	My niece had me download this game so we could play together. It was cute and fun, but unfortunately after the new update the game won't load. Need to fix the bug ASAP!!!!
US	2	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Moochieexox	Disappointed	Ever since the update I haven't been able to get into the game ! It won't fully load PLEASE FIX
US	4	2016-08-15	2.3.2	lagl	Love game, but....	I love this game, but the minor bug update from today is not allowing the game to load. It gets half way then shows a retry button. I hope this gets fixed soon, I have eggs hatching.
US	5	2016-08-15	2.3.2	JasKah	Amazing.	Quality app that offers purchases, but you can get pretty far quickly without paying money. My five year old loves this game!
US	4	2016-08-15	2.3.2	iTzAlphaZx	Most recent update	The most recent update made the game unable to load. It just brings you to the retry screen and it just repeatedly brings you back to it. Great game but this update messed it up.
US	4	2016-08-15	2.3.2	bigteelove	Dragon lover	Very fun to play highly addictive but unless you're connected to face book a lot of the special events are hard to pass unless you want to spend a lot of money
US	5	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Beautiful princess 😸😎	LITERALLY BEST GAME EVER	I love this game so much I have been playing it everyday so addictive and so much fun I LOVE DRAGONS

US	5	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Jsmith15	Dragon mania	I love this game it is amazing
US	4	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Khehdhsuzg	Ok	This game is a lot of fun The one thing is that the lives should be unlimited
US	3	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Lillykw	Waaaaaaaay too many pop-up commercials....	I have been playing this game for a week now... Every time I try to click something, there's a pop-up commercial... Super annoying.... This game is going to be more fun if there's less annoying pop-up commercials....
US	4	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Toridile	Fun game.  :)	I have quite a bit of time clocked into this game, and I am quite pleased with it so far.  It is a casual play that I don't feel so chained down to, and if I wanted, I could wait for hours before checking on my dragons again.  The wait times are very reasonable, so it doesn't feel like you're waiting forever, and gaining gold isn't hard, though losing it is easy, as well, due to all the cool stuff you can buy from the shop.  :)  The only reason I'm giving it a 4-star rating is because of the ads.  They are really random and annoying when they pop up on the screen, causing you to accidentally click to another site.  Other than that, though, it's a really fun game.
US	4	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Dusty Start	Love It!	I absolutely love this game, but some things are a little expensive.
US	5	2016-08-15	2.3.2	<<ianman>>	Fun	Fun and challenging
US	4	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Mommee_of_two	Love it. Very addictive.	I love this game. So does my son. I started playing it because he asked me to play his for a little while to help him out and then j wouldn't give him the phone back. Haha. The only thing that I wish was different was when we breed a dragon and the egg goes into the hatchery, if it's going to hatch into a dragon we already have... I wish we had the option to sell it right away or delete it and breed a different one. Something! Waiting 12 hours or even 6 hours for a dragon I don't even need is incredibly frustrating.
US	5	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Darthamandy	Overall good	It is overall a good game to play. Awesome graphics, fun dragons, always events to participate in, and reasonable tasks to achieve. However, if you don't plan on spending money, plan on be EXTREMELY patient. Most games are like this. I have spent a lot of money on this game, more than I would spend on and x box or PlayStation game with little reward. Now that I am not spending money it is constantly a waiting game. Wish they would help out their loyal costumers! Having said that, the good out weighs the bad very much so :)
US	4	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Holdem6643445776421	Another very addicting game, but the ads are annoying	This could easily be a top game, but they put the ads in your face all the time which is very annoying
US	5	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Lornalouisa	Fun	This game gets better as you go up in levels more fun things are unlocked..it's just fun ..TRUST
US	5	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Pjhedley	Non violent and keeps me entertained	Finally a non violent game that keeps me entertained. Frequent challenges are offered that keeps the game interesting. The only thing I dislike is the difficulty in getting friends to link with on the game which is impossible if you don't know anyone who wants to play it. I'd love to be able to friend people that are playing the game already.
US	5	2016-08-15	2.3.2	쌍둥형제	Good	Cool update
US	5	2016-08-15	2.3.2	Flaka~Lafayette	Divertido	Es lo más tierno que e visto, divertido, interesante si pudiera darle 10 estrellas se los daría pero le doy las 5 estrellas porque es lo más que puedo dar excelente juego, amo a los dragones 😍 lo único malo es a la hora de dar regalos a los amigos de repente no los da y tengo que reiniciar el juego y con eso es con lo que estoy batallando pero por lo demás es excelente

US	5	2016-08-14	2.3.1	Resistance Trooper	The best game ever!!!	My friend told me that I had to download this game and I was like that game looks dumb and boring but I finally downloaded it and it is the best game I have ever played before!😉🤑 thank you so much for making this game!
US	5	2016-08-14	2.3.1	Barkmau	Pretty good	I usually don't play games like this one because of time and gems but this one seems to have grown on me

US	1	2016-08-13	2.3.1	GrayxSilver ONLY	I GOT EMERALD DRAGON	"This game is AWESOME!!! It is #2 favorite! I FINALLY got my Emerald Dragon, my first goal since I downloaded it. I loved this game for 1 year now. I named my Emerald Dragon, Hazel. BBBBBBUUUUUTTTTT... SOMETHING IS WRONG!!!!!! 

1.) Whenever I play the game, stupid ADS pop up, making me tap it, then it will direct me to this stupid website page garbage. When I feed Hazel in the Legendary Habitat, ""Fantasy Forest Story BLAH BLAH WHATEVER"" would just pop out of a mother who is giving birth and MAKE ME ""Tap to hatch an egg!"" Ugh, THAT Ad gets on my nerves! 

2.) PLEASE make a button that ALLOWS you to search up a friend username so you can ACTUALLY BUDDY THEM. 

3.) I WISH YOU CAN DELETE FRIENDS!!! 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
WHY DID YOU ADD THE NAME ""Toby"" TO MY FRIENDS LIST?! I HAVE NO IDEA WHO TOBY SUCKER IS!!!

4.) PLEASE make Legendary Dragons breed-able. This will INCREASE THE CHANCES OF GETTING A LEGENDARY DRAGON!!! Why does Toby HAVE a Legendary Dragon???  

PLEASE make Legendary Dragons breed-able, PLEASE DELETE Toby from my Friends List, PLEASE ADD a Search Username button.
PLEASE DELETE THE SUCKING ADS!!!"

US	4	2016-08-13	2.3.1	Kaiyla B	Now	It's cool for free time 😐
US	1	2016-08-13	2.3.1	Jayce'sWife	Developers are perhaps too greedy	The game just takes too long for basic things and the cost in coins to get any decent island or building or upgrade is outrageous. They have it set up that if you don't want to wait several days for anything worth while you have to pay tons of money. Now I get they need to make money, but they have ads and this insanely priced items both in coins and real money. I have other games of similar gameplay that costs less and takes less time...sorry but one star is being generous.
US	5	2016-08-13	2.3.1	Dreson1123	Awesome	Awesome graphics
US	5	2016-08-12	2.3.1	¥Charizard9402¥	Great	I just got it and love it already!
US	3	2016-08-12	2.3.1	High-5	Ok game but most annoying pop up ad ever	Look, I understand ads but come on, it pop up within 10s that u load the game. Haven't even done anything, just dragging to go to a spot or collecting coins or food and out pop the ads. Then more to follow. It is such a turn off. Sure fire way to guarantee I won't buy any of those things. Won't even give it a second look.
US	2	2016-08-12	2.3.1	Excels Sior	Too many ads.	I don't know if the game is that fun or not honestly, I know the game shovels ads for other games and content at you and that's not fun. Also not fun is constant in app purchase notices. Thanks but no thanks. Here's a hint game loft, make a fun game and monthly I will buy currency to support you.
US	3	2016-08-12	2.3.1	🌺Mem5o🌺	Used to be amazing	I really used to love this game but now whenever the ad loads out of no where my games just freezes and I have to always close out of the game. This is a real disappointment because of how good the game was before. If there was no sudden ad pop ups then I would rate it a 4 or 5.
US	3	2016-08-12	2.3.1	nystateofmind1998	Good, but buggy.	I have had a lot of fun playing the game, but I've also encountered so many problems that I decided to leave a review because I want the game to fixed. The connect to Facebook does not work for me, leaving the prairie dragon out of my reach. It closes and reopens the loading screen almost as soon as I leave the app. I keep having to download all of the same things asking for roughly 150mbs each time. I'm not too bothered by the constant ads, but they are there. If those few things were fixed, I feel the game would be great.
US	5	2016-08-12	2.3.1	Maggie5647382910	Dragon Mania	This is an awesome game! I love it!!
US	3	2016-08-12	2.3.1	Mastershot117	Good game (but)	This game is fun but I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate all the pop ups and you trying to send me to the Internet all the time and I mean all the time. Please fix this I would give u a 5 star other wise

US	4	2016-08-12	2.3.1	Cowgirl MADDY	Amazing	Amazing game! I love the graphics and the sounds! A lot better than Dragon Story ! Please remember to remove the ads ! 💕💕👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
US	5	2016-08-12	2.3.1	Anariel Phoenix Blade	S	So far so good.
US	3	2016-08-12	2.3.1	Pinkie to the pie	FIX YOUR GAME!	It's very good but I had my friends use my code and it didn't register that they used it... Also it loses connection CONSTANTLY! And i know my wifi is good so it's not that... Get a better SERVER!
US	3	2016-08-11	2.3.1	CupidsFury	Very enjoyable but...	This game is very fun and there seems to always be something to do although every 3mins a ad pops up in the middle of the game and it's not like the other ads this one just keeps popping up and takes the entire screen and it makes regular game play seem less an less worth it
US	5	2016-08-11	2.3.1	81Reecie	Dragon Mania legends	I'm new at this, but so far I'm enjoying!
US	5	2016-08-11	2.3.1	Wilialdo perez	It's great	You can interact with your dragons, you can battle and you can care for your dragons, it's a great game
US	5	2016-08-11	2.3.1	Alyssa_2004	Awsome	I love this game loads of fun!!
US	1	2016-08-11	2.3.1	KhajiitMane	Enchantment	"I can't stand this new enchantment feature! It's basically IMPOSSIBLE to enchant dragons. It's taking forever for me to gather ""trinkets"" or whatever just to enchant one freaking dragon! I hate it! And when you go to battle in the league you have NO IDEA what dragons your coming up against since it doesn't show all of them. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 The game was amazing! I don't understand why it had to be changed!"
US	5	2016-08-11	2.3.1	Killer_Kittens	Dragons!!	This is a really fun game! Of course the advertisements can get annoying, but all-in-all, fun game!
US	2	2016-08-11	2.3.1	Amiga Freak	Unbounded and mysterious grind	This game gives you no visibility into what future upgrades will cost, and should be no surprise to anyone that what starts out as a fun and engaging experience turns into an arduous grind.  To make matters worse, this UI is terrible, the islands fill up fast and there is no layout editor.  Battles are purely level based with a little bit of rock paper scissor when levels are equal.  Breeding is mysterious and legendaries nearly impossible to breed.  For example, I spent the past five months attempting to breed a legendary to no effect.  Money packs are ridiculously expensive and are pointless to buy.

US	5	2016-08-09	2.3.1	Ksdhdjdjhd dnsj	Breeding and more	I was introduced by graveyardgirl or bunny. But it was the event with different animals and the charity event I believe and I thought I give it a try. I immediately fell in love I'm addicted to it now. The only thing I would Change is for the amount of habitats you can have. I had to wait till level 23 to get a new habitat to place my brick dragon and I had to move a lot of my dragons around but I think you should have as many habitats as you want
US	2	2016-08-09	2.3.1	Avensdesora	Too many ads!	Every other tap is an ad that doesn't even load properly.
US	3	2016-08-09	2.3.1	babykisses37	Okay	I like the game.i just wish I could connect to Facebook.It won't let me log in.....could this problem be fix.....
US	1	2016-08-09	2.3.1	paramedicmelissa	Just ok	An ok game.  Has a lot of pop up advertisements that's extremely annoying!  If you don't like getting bumped from your game to watch a dumb advertisement don't play this game.  Extremely difficult to advance in the game unless you pay lots of $$$$.
US	5	2016-08-08	2.3.1	Dino power x 5	Top 5 center	This is one of my top five games on the AppStore it's awesome and I love the new iOS loyalty reward it's a fire ball dragon also i want to thank game loft for making this great game and many other great games
US	4	2016-08-08	2.3.1	Chesiey	Request	Since Suicide Squad just cane out! I was wondering if u could make dragons out of the characters! It would be totally awesome if u did. I would really appreciate it. Thank you
US	5	2016-08-08	2.3.1	BrainsDealer	Pretty good	I've tried a few other dragon games and so far this one is the best. The graphics and the details of the dragons are wonderful. I also enjoy the style of battling that's involved compared to simply tapping your enemy which doesn't do much.
US	2	2016-08-08	2.3.1	Aimabug	ok...	this game is fun but the ads are too much, i cant do a single thing without an ad showing up, so unless you decrease the amount of ads, im giving you a two star, everyone who agrees with me rate 2 stars and write a review and add #toomanyads
US	1	2016-08-08	2.3.1	SFPaddy	Terrible	Awful game riddled with constant pop-up ads specifically designed so that the user almost can't avoid clicking through on them. Developers are clearly trying to force click through traffic that they can show advertisers how much traffic their game can produce. Rotten scammers with no respect for their customers and they believe they can fraudulently report the return on investment for their advertisers. If I get your add on my screen 10 times in the space of an hour I will never try your product because the only thing you are doing is interrupting my game and making me mad!
US	3	2016-08-08	2.3.1	NASCAR fan 17	iOS Facebook issues	Game is fun can't get it to sync with Facebook... Any other iOS people having issues
US	3	2016-08-07	2.3.1	.Drag0n85.	2 things wrong	I enjoy this game but when I want to battle in the arena the people that show up are level hard, even when I refresh. Another thing is that I can't redeem friendship codes
US	5	2016-08-07	2.3.1	QqwrtyuoppFjllagk	Wooooooooow	Woooooow I love this game so much
US	4	2016-08-07	2.3.1	Tixktdkgdlhfoyoydgupo	AWESOME GAME BUUUTT.....	It's a pretty cool game that is just soooooooo fun but it's just the ads I really don't like. Everytime I try to do something, an ad just pops up. It's really annoying when it happens. It would be great if there were not that many ads. Overall, awesome game and I give it 4 stars.
US	5	2016-08-07	2.3.1	KitKat 🐘	Getting the same tasks	I was really enjoying this new game that I was introduced to by my family and was happy to find a game that I could check every once in a while and have tasks. After the update the graphics were blurry, but now are a little bit better. Still not as clear as before the update. The thing that didn't get better was my daily tasks. I had two ❤️  , a battle task, and a habitat task, and a little red dragon task. For the last few days I kept getting the same battle tasks, no habitat tasks or little red dragon tasks. My sisters tasks went back to normal but mine hasn't. This game is still my currently favorite game but it is not what it used to be. I would like to have different tasks and not the same 3. The tasks that keep reappearing are to defeat a dragon through dragon fury, get a perfect hit, and win a battle. I am currently on level 23.
US	4	2016-08-07	2.3.1	Cbrady00	Pretty good update	"The update is cool, but here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
*New dragons - Yup, there are new dragons. The ones I am aiming for the most are Origami, Owl, Firefly and Pineapple.
*New island - An new island is unveiled, but costs way higher than the Garden.
*Enchancements - This update introduces Enchancements, which seems handy since you need them to fight in Enchancement battles.

Cons:
*The Close-Ups - The close-ups of the dragons and islands are now kind-off pixeled. Wish you can fix this.
*Levels - You need specific enchantment levels to breed specific dragons now."
US	5	2016-08-07	2.3.1	Julianna Linnea	I love it!!! But☹	It's a lot of fun and I can't wait to collect all of the dragons! But it won't let me connect to facebook☹ and I really want the dragon that you get when you connect. Whenever I try it just loads and never stops loading, I have to restart the app for it to stop. Please fix this😭
US	1	2016-08-06	2.3.1	KingBuffo	Fun Game but....	There's this one pop up ad that comes up with about every 5 taps on the screen and you have to buy so much stuff with real money!!! It would be a good game if the developers hadn't made it the greedy way it is.😡👎🏿

US	2	2016-08-06	2.3.1	Lantz03	DO NOT UPDATE	"I used to love this game. It's pretty much the only thing I've been able to do 45 days straight in my entire life. HOWEVER. They released the new update and ruined the game. There are so many glitches and connection issues. The enchantment features don't make sense. And I was thisclose to getting a Cookir Dragon with the old Daily Quests. But they got rid of the old rewards and implemented something new that makes no sense at all.

Basically, if you can avoid it, DO NOT UPDATE. If you download after the update and only get to play the new version, well, I'm truly sorry you only get the experience of this new crap version."
US	4	2016-08-06	2.3.1	EmperorDuckie	Good game… with issues.	First of all, I like the game, and dragons period. But there is a big problemo. Whenever certain pop-ups pop-up (pun intended), the game looks the same (no freezing, crashing, etc.), but if I tap something, nothing happens! Please fix!

US	5	2016-08-06	2.3.1	Diana leo29	Dragon mania legends	This game is very interesting to play. The only thing I don't really like about it is that the islands to open the price is outrages. It would be better if they lower it and as far as doing quest our prize should be more money and more then 1 diamonds.Also it's so much to feed the dragons ,it should be slightly lower.

US	4	2016-08-05	2.3.1	Sdellin	Great Game	"I really love the game.  My grandson and I both play together.  We share a game on my iPad and he plays on his iPhone.  We send each other pics of the dragons we breed when we are not together.  

The one problem we have is that on his iPhone ads will pop up in the game and he can't even watch them, they just freeze and he has to restart the game.  He gets very frustrated (he's 9).  I wish that would be fixed, as in he can go to Otto's balloon to watch videos.

Also, I don't like being forced to buy temples, not sure what the need is.   Other than that the game is super fun!

IT SHOULD NOT TAKE SO MUCH FOOD TO ADVANCE DRAGONS!  ITS IMPOSSIBLE!"

US	1	2016-08-05	2.3.1	Breeze214	Gotten Worse Over Time - Fake 5⭐️Reviews	"The ""super fun, fantastical, lots to do, super addicting"" 5-star reviews are FAKE!!!   This game used to be fun.  I reinstalled this game after more than a year of not playing and sadly, the reason I stopped playing hasn't changed - deleting this money grubbing, crap.  My review from sometime in 2014:  I've spent REAL MONEY playing this game and put in lots of hours.  The reward for being such a player seems to be ""Thanks sucker"".  The updates have incrementally slowed my progress to the point that I'm barely interested in playing.   The resources required to access new islands at higher levels are starting at 50 million coins?!?!  I really enjoyed playing the game in the beginning.  Progress to the levels higher than 25 require a huge amount of resources to continue.  Waiting used to take a few days of collecting coins but now it's going to take weeks to get enough resources.  Playing the game at a snails pace is quite boring."
US	4	2016-08-04	2.3.1	Holdem6643445776421	Fun but the ads are too intrusive	Other similar games the ads aren't right in your face all the time, makes the game much less fun.
US	3	2016-08-04	2.3.1	merp924394263	Love the Game, Bugs after recent update	Hi I flat out love playing, my whole family plays this across different devices it's a game we bond over. However after the most recent update none of us have been able to get back into the game, it practically freezes up and kicks us out. I hope this gets fixed soon :(

US	2	2016-08-04	2.3.1	Missashely12	Great game- Ad hungry	I like this game but the massive amount of ads is overwhelming. They appear when you are petting dragons and are waiting around. They also drown you in ads after changing pages and clicking things. I hate the massive amount of ads killing the amount of fun you could have with fusteration.
US	2	2016-08-04	2.3.1	+Ridiculous+	Too many ads	This is a fun game.  There is a lot to do: breed dragons, battles, unlock quests, limited events, etc.  However, there are way TOO MANY ADS!!!  They pop up about every minute, sometimes 15-30 s videos, sometimes click on ads.  You can be in the middle of game play, like petting a dragon for gold, and an ad pops up (even as the gold is moving to your collection bar) and you end up touching the screen (again, because you are in the middle of game play).  This is totally ridiculous and if the makers of the game don't ease up on the ads, I'm deleting this game soon.  (There are already ads that pop up on the bottom of the screen and for voluntary watching to earn gems...these are tolerable).

US	2	2016-08-04	2.3.1	Lisa4bells	Re: Cute game but.....	Due to the game getting interrupted every few minutes with ads which either take you to the Internet, make you watch a 30 second video or shut down the app completely, I'm switching over to another dragon type game. I thought I could tolerate all the interruptions, but nope, there's just to many of them. When I start seeing reviews that the pop up ads are gone, I will start playing the game again. It actually was quite fun.
US	3	2016-08-04	2.3.1	Surprise app	Constant ADDS !	I love the game but this is not for children specially when the adds pop up all the time and take you to safari. Wish there was an option to buy the game so no adds show up.So many commercials that ruin the fun ...

US	5	2016-08-03	2.3.1	Bigbearwaffles123	3rd Stage Final Forms??	"Dragon Mania Legends is an amazing game!! Extremely fun! I love the fact that the game is affordable and fair. Meaning coins and gems. As in, buying a habitat or dragon in the game won't make you bankrupt. I love the whole deal of how generous the dragons are, it lets you enjoy the game, to be able to afford in game items. The only thing I really REALLY wish, was if dragons were able to evolve one more time. This would be their final 3rd evolution. I mean, if there are baby and ""teen"" dragons, why not have them become adults? To be honest, the dragons look under developed. They are begging for a final adult form! Overall this game is awesome and deserves all 5 stars!"

When I go to enchant my 2nd dragon (free) clicking enchant free does nothing at all. Its as if the button is broken. Can not even exit out the box or claim gold or anything because no buttons respond. Please fix! Using iPhone 6

I don't know why it won't let me exit the area. It's like stuck on getting a specific dragon enchanted even though I didn't receive the required crystal things. It won't even offer to let me purchase the required crystals, the blue arrow is stuck on the 'FREE' enchantment button. It's a pain in the butt, I'll keep trying and hope you fix the problem. If not I'll be stuck removing the game.

The variety of dragons ands heir features and colours  are so interesting.

As for the comment on bugs, there are times where a blue arrow just stays on my screen or even times where building icons wouldn't go away until I closed the app. Thank you for your time, and to be honest it has potential to be great it just needs to take care of those quirks.

This game is absolutely amazing and awesome. And the dragons are absolutely adorable. I hope all the complainers will read this. The map get harder as you progress on to it. I'm not trying to brag, but the boss Venomia was quite easy especially since I had 2 level 14 Dragons and 1 level 16 dragon. I am now on the third map. I also want to thank the creators of this game for the dungeon update. I could not have been on the map were I am without the dungeon. 
Thank you Game loft. You can actually interact with you dragons.😍 :-)"

But overall this is and awesome game!😊👏🏼👍🏼❤️"
US	5	2016-07-21	2.2.0	Schneweizer	Love it! Use my code to add me db339e	It's highly addicting! I have played another game very similar to this (I won't name names) but this beat it in a landslide. However, I wish it was easier to gain the vip access for only 2 days it cost 49 diamonds. I feel that's a bit ridiculous. I also wish that the same competitions and promotions were available to all players not just VIP. Another thing is I do keep running into this odd issue where I'll get on the app and at random times all of my dragons are greyed out and they have question marks by them... Then it makes me re-download all my dragon data again? It's very odd. It gets frustrating having to do it multiple times and I'm not quite sure what causes it.

US	5	2016-07-20	2.2.0	🐉DML🐉	Great game overall	"It's a pretty good game, but I have a few complaints.
1. I wish it wouldn't take so long to get good dragons and other stuff, but the (most) wait times aren't ridiculous, as long as you have something else to do
2. I want the hatchery and portal to have coin upgrades, not just jewel upgrades
3. I wish there were less random popup ads. I mean, I don't mind watching one or two ads to get an extra spin on the lottery wheel, but I wish there weren't so many random ads that pop up out of nowhere.
4. I wish the type matchup chart was a little easier to read...I have lost countless battles because I misinterpreted the chart
Despite this, there are MANY good things about this game-
1. Jewels aren't IMPOSSIBLE to get without spending money...I actually have quite a lot and I haven't spent a single penny
2. The graphics are pretty great...better than the original Dragon Mania, if anyone remembers that
3. I love how renting Toby's dragon now costs energy instead of jewels in either the original Dragon Mania or a previous version of Dragon Mania Legends...I don't really remember

Anyway, this game is pretty good (I know I've said that like 20 times) and it's definitely worth getting, even if progressing can be a bit slow... Hope this review helps!!"

US	5	2016-07-19	2.2.0	Ugalde	Super Fun!	"Got the game when one of my favorite YouTubers was part of the Golden Paw event. Tried playing just so I could donate my golden paws to her charity. That was almost a month ago and I'm still playing. 

Pros
1. Beautiful looking game! Huge variety of dragons!!
2. Breeding dragons is fun...downside, it takes FOREVER!

Cons: 
1. too many ads!!! I hope Gameloft reads these reviews because it seems to be a common complaint they can do something about.

2. If you want to spend real money be prepared to spend a lot. Gems are ridiculously expensive for what you get and during gameplay you earn a micro fraction of what you need. Frustrating!

I'll keep playing for one more month and then I think I will be done, but totally fun while it lasts"

US	1	2016-07-19	2.2.0	Rendrassa	Would be best game but for ads.	A friend recommended this game to me, and I see why. The graphics are nice and smooth, the dragons have cool designs and the battle system is interesting. What I have come to absolutely hate are the random, mandatory ads that are very hard to skip and often end up taking me to a webpage out of game because it popped up as I was touching the screen. (And if I stop to delete the tab in Safari, I've taken to long to get back into the game and it has to reload.) There is a way to earn free gems through ad views, and since that's the case, I don't believe players should be forced to view ads when the creators earn money through the elective ad viewing that players choose. My BF played this game for three days before rage quitting, and I'm deleting the app myself now. Want more players to fall in love with your game? At least cut down in the no-skip, transport you out of game ads!
US	3	2016-07-18	2.2.0	gormone	Apple iOS update	After the Apple iOS update this afternoon app crashes. Please fix. And if you didn't update yet don't right away.
US	5	2016-07-18	2.2.0	Zbxncmv,	Awesome	I love this game but I don't like wating
US	4	2016-07-18	2.2.0	LoveIT^_^	Amazing Game✨	"Dragons Mania Legends is a great way to spend your time and to anyone who wants to download it, you definitely should. It isn't hard to get legendary dragons in this game, which is what I love most about it. There's no need to spend heaps of money to be a top player, or any money at all.

There have been some annoying ads lately but that's to be expected within any game. Plus it isn't hard to click out of the ads (at least on a windows PC, may be difficult for people on smartphones). I hope Gameloft doesn't get overwhelmed with power and money and starts putting annoying ads everywhere. It used to be five stars, but now it's four because Gameloft seems to be slowly turning into money monsters. But hey, corruption is bound to happen to anyone with power and money. Still, I just hope that green pieces of paper won't be a tool that'll control Gameloft.

Additionally, there are technical issues **sometimes** but Gameloft is always kind enough to resolve them if u send a ticket or leave a message on Facebook.

Overall, the game is extremely enjoyable and suitable for people of all ages. Highly recommended.

Note this though: this game requires A LOT OF PATIENCE. Breeding, leveling up, hatching, building, and all that take up a lot of time. However, I'd say it's well worth it. If you can wait one hour for something to be bred, then you can wait a few more hours for the dragon to be hatched. All you have to do is wait, and there's no harm in waiting. In the beginning, progress is slow but after a while, things really start to speed up. I remember struggling to buy a water dragon. Now I have literally millions of coins (At least 15+ Million gold per day) and hundreds of gems. The best part is that I haven't spend a penny on this game. Players just have to get creative with the options presented to you and make the most out of it.  There's so many ways to earn gems. So, I'd disagree with people who say that you won't get anywhere with this game unless you have money. It's all about the attitude that you approach the game with. 

I'd say this is one if the best games to play for free and if you want other benefits, they're nice to have but not needed, you can always buy VIP. 

Next, I want to say that unlike what others have said, it's very easy to go up in ranks this way. The rewards of your hard work will be seen in the long-term. So if u spend time with this game, you will progress greatly. I know because when I was just a mere level 7, I bred my first legendary dragon. Of course not everyone is lucky but it is fairly easy to breed a legendary dragon. One legendary dragon is available for everyone to breed once a month. Legendary dragons tend to repeat, so if u didn't get it this month, u can always try when it becomes available again. Plus, you have an entire month to breed the dragon so... I'd say it's pretty easy to build a strong team and go up in ranks. 

Suggestions:

- New islands for habitats. I've already filled up all 7 islands. And I still haven't bred all available dragons. Maybe the new islands could be light and shadow themed to honor the addition of light and shadow dragons. Or maybe there could be an island dedicated to legendary dragons.

- The maximum amount of habitats should be raised. I need more than 40 legendary habitats. I like to maximize my profits so I definitely need a lot of legendary habitats.

- When an egg is hatched from the hatchery, it should also have a checkmark saying if we own this dragon already or not. I've been playing for over a year already so I've accumulated a lot of dragons. I remember most of my dragons but I can't remember all. That's why it'll be helpful to know if we have to sell these hatched dragons or not.

- I think it's about time we're able to rotate buildings, habitats, and decorations. I'm a picky person when it comes to how my islands look so I want to be able to customize it fully.

- Like I said before, I like to maximize my profits. That's why 30,000 gold as the maximum capacity for legendary habitats is too little. We should be able to upgrade legendary habitats. It doesn't have to change in appearance or size but the gold capacity should at least be increased. I have legendary dragons that range from levels 30-70 and I like to keep 1 legendary dragon in one habitat to maximize profits, but that isn't space efficient. I don't have time to constantly check this game to collect gold because I'm a very busy person. In addition, I can't just pull out this game because even though I'm posting this review on iOS, I actually play this on a windows PC. 

- Also, in the Book of Dragons, when we click on a dragon, we should also be able to see what Island that dragon is on. When I moved all my fire, wind, earth, and water dragons to legendary habitats to maximize profits, it was hectic finding where each dragon was.

- This is just another suggestion, but what if each player got a ""wall"" and so other plays can post messages on that wall. Sending private messages would also be nice so that players can exchange tips or talk about other things. In addition, if a player visited their friends, they could get a small reward ( such as gold or food ) simply for visiting and/or leaving a message. I think this would promote more interactivity on this game. The only time I interact with other players are when I decide to visit them (probably happens once or twice a year) or in the arena. I haven't joined a clan because most clans want active players and I can't be as active as they want me to. Also, players could leave messages telling others to add them on Facebook. This would help players gain friends.

- Another suggestion is that we would be able to challenge our friends or other players to a battle. This would be a friendly battle to see how strong your friends are or what dragons they have. This would also be very useful for when clans are recruiting members and they want to see how strong you are.  

And this concludes my review. ^^"
US	1	2016-07-17	2.2.0	TabascoGator	Ruined by ads!	The ads are aggressive and horribly inconvenient. They pop up under your finger, forcing you to accidentally click them, taking you to another page that you have to close and then reopen your game. I would like the game, and even thought about spending some $ on it, until the frustration of these badly-placed ads made me decide to uninstall the whole game instead.
US	5	2016-07-17	2.2.0	Animal💜er88	One of the best games I've ever played!❤️	This game is amazing! I just downloaded it less than an hour  ago and I'm already obsessed! First of all, the dragons are really cute! Second, I love the imaginative and mystical theme this game has along with the magical music!😄 Bottom line is, I love this game and I can't wait to build my dragon empire! Thank you for inventing this awesome game!
US	4	2016-07-16	2.2.0	Gandalf the 23 Gamer	Why	So I had been playing the game, and it's a really fun game (if you can get past all the ads) but then I log on and some of my dragons are silhouettes and have question marks on them. And when I click on them is says I need to download more. Why, everything was fine, why do I need to download.

US	5	2016-07-16	2.2.0	Llama/potato	YESSSS	I am already so amazed by this app this game has a story line and battles I don't find this in many dragon games I think a lot of people would like to have this game try it out at least
US	5	2016-07-16	2.2.0	Wikiwiki1	Ad Glitch Help!	This game is a ton of fun and it doesn't deserve to be rated poorly for one problem. However, the last few times I've played, I've had an ad that wants to pop up on the screen but never actually appears. Well... it's just invisible and I can't exit out of it. So although I can see the game fine and everything is moving, I can't move anything myself. If anyone else is having this problem, write a review also to get this fixed please! Thanks!

US	5	2016-07-15	2.2.0	Thequietmonster	One of my favorite games!	This game is really good and it's 1 of my favorites.  The ads are getting annoying, but almost every game I have has some ads in it so I'm fine with it.
US	4	2016-07-15	2.2.0	AidualcEuv321	Recruitment	In the app, are we allowed to recruit only one friend?? Because it only lets us recruit one friend.

US	3	2016-07-14	2.2.0	Mickietta	Too many long ads	I love the game, it is absolutely beautiful and I would love to continue playing it, but after a day of 15 second ads and taken from the game to a website for ads every few minutes liked to drove me insane. I think it would be worth 5 stars without all the ads. They bothered me so much I had to delete the game. I'm gonna miss it 🙁 Maybe they'll make an update with fewer ads 🤗
US	4	2016-07-14	2.2.0	Onery1	So far not too bad	Just started playing this game, I am liking it, still learning but not bad. Thank you Onery.   Enough with the extra data ! Spent money but ready to quit , constantly having to make room to play and see my dragons !
US	2	2016-07-13	2.2.0	Shynoke	Dragon city is better	After reviewing thks Gabe for my daughter here is my feedback....Too many ads, server slow 🐌, graphics minimal, and finally all the work done in five minutes was not saved. My daughter recommends Dragon city. None of these problems there.

US	5	2016-07-12	2.2.0	Fgchgcguutu	Dragon ML	This is a great game
US	2	2016-07-12	2.2.0	Whoorwhatever	This app has gone way down hill.	"This used to be a 4+ star app.

Pros:
- Great graphics (although some of the dragons lately aren't so good with low red graphics).
-Large number of dragons with a good variety of types.
-Good amount of different things to do in the game - helps to keep the game from getting boring so quickly.

Cons:
-Extremely slow to develop unless you have thousands of dollars (or at least hundreds) to spend on the game.
-Flakey unless you have an extremely robust and stable high speed internet connection (don't spend any money on this game if you don't, or you may lose your investment).
-In app purchases are exceedingly expensive.  I estimate that there are a number of players that have spent literally several thousand dollars on this game.
-The adds are by far the worst I have ever seen for any app, and have only gotten worse in the last couple of months.  Some of the video adds will pop up repeatedly every few minutes, with usually 15 seconds before you can quit the add.  Gets really bad after you have seen the add several dozen times.  Some of the adds are designed to exit the game and take you to some web site - extremely disruptive of game play.  Again, these adds can pop up every few minutes.  The adds make it much more difficult to play the game than it should be
GameLoft is milking this cash cow so hard it's turning inside out."

And the worst part is that when I spun the wheel, it seems like they rigged the game, because no matter how many times I was suppose to win gems, it automatically turns to food instead! Overall, crap game, and I hate how they try to make you purchase everything as you progress on.

•Dragon Battle Glitches (Reason: When it glitched, one of my dragons instantly died when it was my turn to attack and after that, it crashed!)

•Cash problems?
•Too expensive to buy a lot of stuff that are needed for dragons and battles?
•Egg hatchling (Reason: For some odd reason, everytime I check up on my new incubating egg, it disappears and lags me!)"

The only thing I have a problem with is the daily prizes. I go in everyday but the daily prize doesn't pop up, only on occasion, which causes me not to make any progress and get any closer to the dragon egg. Please fix this!
US	3	2016-07-10	2.2.0	selena gomez edits	This game is awesome but.......	I love this game I've had it for about 7 months, well there's one thing I don't understand which is why can't a get a habitat it says you have the maximum habitat which gets me so so mad and those ads like are you kidding me but for the most part this game is pretty fun👌👌😆
US	4	2016-07-10	2.2.0	AkatsukiKingdom	Ad problems	The ads popping up out of nowhere and when you're petting the dragons and the ad pops up and you hit the ad not knowing it, takes you to the Internet and when you get out of it and back to the game, the game starts to lag and not respond, not to mention when you hit the X to close the ad it takes you to the Internet, also it caused the game to crash. Please fix this, I love this game but not the ads.
US	2	2016-07-09	2.2.0	K$$$$	Good, too many ads	The game has great potential to easily be 5 stars, but there are way too many ads. With games like this, when their are too many ads, you always end up deleting them

US	5	2016-07-09	2.2.0	Newby2015	TONS of Ads	Every ad that comes up it will lock up the screen, then I have to close out of the game completely!

US	4	2016-07-08	2.2.0	Penolope	good, too many ads	this is a great app, I play all the time and there's never an end, which means there's always a goal to achieve or something to do. however, wayyy too many ads. I can barely do anything in the app before another ad pops up. I wouldn't mind, if the ads could just be clicked out of right away, but most of the time they're videos that last anywhere between 15 seconds and a minute. very inconvenient if you are just trying to quickly collect your coins and go.
US	5	2016-07-08	2.2.0	Kageamayasan	Love this game!!	I love this game! If you couldn't tell by the title! I love that they have a mass amount of dragons to claim! And each one is so creatively made! My personal favourites are the bumble bee dragon and the salamander dragon! So cute! Game play is addictive and challenging but not too hard! Keeps you entertained and wanting to play more! I love the variety this game offers! Totally worth the download!
US	3	2016-07-08	2.2.0	RiniKat28	This is from my sister, who plays dml on desktop and ergo cannot review on here.	"So, ever since the Clans arrived, I've been wanting to join one, but couldn't yet due to my level. [RiniKat28] created a clan that I was hoping to join, but since desktop is so stuPID, I can't connect with anyone /even though/ I'm connected through Facebook. Since I couldn't join it, I spent the 1.5 MILLION COINS to create my own clan. I was at level 22 at the time (which [RiniKat28] found odd even then). 
The next day, someone joined my clan and I still couldn't do Clan Chat or anything other than view their islands and basic stuff. 
I wasn't able to go on for a few days, but when I did, I COULDN'T GO ON MY CLAN. It showed on the castle that I had indeed created a clan and was in said clan, yet I wasn't able to click on my clan because it said I needed to be Level 25 to access the clans. 
Now, that makes sense since that is the actual requirement to join the Clan Bandwagon™, but then WHY IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY DID YOU ALLOW ME TO CREATE A CLAN IN THE FIRST PLACE???? 
I spent 1.5 MILLION coins on a clan I CAN'T EVEN USE YET
WHY"

The farm prices make no sense. 30 seconds =5 food...5 min = 25 food....30 min = 75 food....you realize I could get 75 food faster and cheaper doing 30 seconds over and over right? 

$100 for one legendary dragon. It's a waste of time. Just a huge scheme for them to get tons of money off a tired game."
US	1	2016-07-06	2.2.0	Ta fivifuguzcviv	😒👎👎	I gave only a 1 star because too many adds come up and every time I get to a certain point of the game the game restarts all the way from the beginning and what the point of playing a game over and over and over again without getting any farther.
US	4	2016-07-06	2.2.0	Teddy-Fu	Great game, but too many ads.	This game is really cute and well made. There's just enough to do to keep you interested, very aesthetically pleasing graphics, simple gameplay, and lots of adorable dragons to play with. My one problem is that there's TOO MANY ADS. The ads always pop up when you're in the middle of something, and make the game freeze and crash. Sometimes it happens in the middle of a battle and you lose EVERYTHING. Also, the gem costs to speed up things shouldn't be based on minutes. Gems are way too expensive and hard to collect for that to be fair.
US	5	2016-07-06	2.2.0	Marialaico123	Really Fun	Honestly I don't like playing games on my phone but I couldn't pass this one up. It's really fun to pet the dragons and battle, build things and get new dragons! It's so adorable to pet dragons and you earn money while doing it to get food for the dragons to level them up! This is the best game I have ever played! Definitely recommend it
US	2	2016-07-06	2.2.0	PorcelainInkDoll	Way too many ads	"The game is gorgeous and very addictive. The ads, however, are extremely frustrating. They pop up so frequently and they crash the app once in a while which forces some progress to be lost. There needs to be a better ad system or an option to pay for ad removal.
Otherwise the actual game play was thoroughly thought out and really fun to play. I love that you can interact with the dragons and train their elemental abilities."

If u were even questioning about getting the app, no doubt about it just press GET, INSTALL and type in ur Apple ID password and get it for pete sake. I love this game!!! I have tried EVERY dragon game out there and there is seriously NOTHING like this!❤️ 
The graphics, sounds, challenges, quests, battles, habitats, all 💯%. Except the adds.😑 
Every time I open the app, adds! Every time I collect money from my dragons, adds! Every time I collect food from my farms, adds! Every time I buy something new, adds! EVERY TIME I PUT A NEW DRAGON IN ITS HABITAT ADDS!!!😡😡😡 
I have had enough of these adds! And every time they're the same ones! It's actually starting to drive me crazy. I mean look at the other descriptions⬆️. Most of the love the game, except the adds. OHH THEY'RE KILLING ME!!!💥🔫💣🔪 I rly hope I made a point in this description. Plz get rid of the adds! Please! PLEASE!!! 
And two more things: I like the music but the sounds that come out of the dragons mouths r just weird. U rly should change those.
And two: u rly should organize the way u set up the spot to buy ur dragons. For example: when u press the store button and it goes to the dragons u can buy automatically it has all of the same element dragons in the same spot which is nice, but u have all of the VIP and other dragons completely mixed in with the fire and wind and earth and other dragons. I know this was long but it was worth writing. Get rid of the adds! The other stuff is minor, except the the adds!!!"

Remove the ads and I will change my rating to 5 stars and actually buy gems.

SO MAKE SURE YOU GET THIS APP"
US	4	2016-07-01	2.2.0	Zippydoodles	Review	I love this game, it makes my sister and friends so excited to get new dragons and make more as well. I would advise many people to get this game if they like to beat other dragons and go on to different levels.
US	3	2016-07-01	2.2.0	Risingofthe100demon	About Facebook.......	The Facebook special get 10 gems and a dragon takes forever to load, that I do not want to go through, please make the waiting time shorter
US	5	2016-07-01	2.2.0	Zandrick Krowe	This Game Is So Much Fun!!	I love this concept and how you interact with your dragons; you feel as if they really are yours. I don't really like the constant ads but hey, you gotta advertise. I do really like this game, however I wish you could zoom out all the way to get everything into view. Other than that, great game. 😀
US	5	2016-07-01	2.2.0	Hairdini The Great	If I Could Make a Game for Myself, THIS WOULD BE IT!	I am OBSESSED with this game!  There isn't a single thing I would change.  The graphics, the sound, the events, contests, clans.... I could go on and on.  Kudos to the creators for keeping my attention by new things happening all the time and for rewards to be obtainable avoiding any frustration, which happens so often in games like this.  I can honestly say that this is one of a few games that I have actually spent money on (not because I needed too, but wanted too) and have no regrets about it!  I would have given 10 stars if I could!
US	5	2016-06-30	2.2.0	Meee11232	Sweet	An awesome game this is!
US	5	2016-06-30	2.2.0	xGrimWolfx13	Fun!	Very time consuming and it is a fun game.

US	4	2016-06-30	2.2.0	Totally not cool but cute	It a good app but	I love the game but to many ads in we you need gems you there no ads
US	4	2016-06-30	2.2.0	Chandralw	Great game!	Graphics and game play are amazing I wish it wasn't so hard to get food to level up dragons, the higher levels the longer you have to wait to get a good enough amount to level your dragon up maybe half way if you're lucky. It would be amazing if you could also buy scrolls! Even after I earn a bunch it still isn't enough for my higher level dragons....I love the promotion deal but I hate once the dragon is gone it's gone for good.
US	5	2016-06-29	2.2.0	Avarod	Love it!!!	Love it! It's very addicting
US	5	2016-06-29	2.2.0	Hwgebdbsjke sis	So good	I love this game I think it is better then dragon city.
US	2	2016-06-29	2.2.0	Kcc145	Ehhh...	If you don't have friends on Facebook that play or a Facebook in general that play then you have no way to get to places on the map you should be able to friend people around your area or something. The ads pop up too much and just freeze the game too.
US	1	2016-06-29	2.2.0	Bryan9107382974782	Can you do anything before the ad pops up?	It's you against the ads...  Try to collect your gold before the annoying 30 second ad ruins your fun.  They come up in the middle of battles, pretty much anytime you touch the screen more than 4 times.  I finally got fed up with it and deleted the game.  Terrible implementation of an ad-based revenue stream.
US	3	2016-06-29	2.2.0	UndyneTheUndying11	The Ads.. but..	So this game is super fun! But what really ruins it is the ads... Just EVERY SEcond I SEE A  FREAKING AD! Just stop!  I would  rate it 5 if you would  stop!
US	4	2016-06-29	2.2.0	Geminiderp	Promising!!	Has some glitches where the arrows pop up randomly. Love the art style though and will just hope for patches on the game!
US	5	2016-06-29	2.2.0	Rabeh Azzabi	Gameloft Thanks 👌🏻	العبة رائعة وممتعة ولكن يجب ان تكون تنانين معروفة هل هيا ذكر ام أنثي حتي يكون التزاوج اكثر واقعية وشكرا مرة اخر
US	5	2016-06-29	2.2.0	Stokes3551464277	Download this game	This game is very intriguing I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about downloading it.
US	5	2016-06-29	2.2.0	MommyAu	Cool😎	This game is great you can upgrade skills and breed. Normally in other games you can't breed dragons that cost a lot gems but in this game you can
US	2	2016-06-29	2.2.0	NerdyAngelic	Disappointing	I used to really be addicted to this game but then all the annoying ads popped up and their is absolutely obsessed way to get them off the screen and the ads have no skips or Xs to skip out so then my phone or iPad freezes and I have to restart my game and some of my data gets lost and ill have to re-breed my dragons which is absolutely annoying. I have now been thinking and game-loft if you don't take off the ads then I'm just deleting the game after I finish this reveiw and I'm going back to dragon vale or dragons world because those games are ad free and addicting so I recommend you fix the adds but yeah 2star is my reveiw😜🦄
US	4	2016-06-29	2.2.0	CosmosWolf24	HOW IS IT SO GOOD	I bought this game yesterday and I am obsessed with it already. I love breeding all the different types of dragons and leveling them up to see their actual awesomeness. I like a game with better graphics, but I guess it's for kids so it makes sense, I still do kinda wish that the graphics were a bit more realistic because I'm a dragon lover FOREVER but other than that it's an amazing, great game. Honestly I downloaded it thinking it was gonna be just another dumb, low quality game but I was playing it all night after that. The battles are really fun to try and win and see the other cool dragons. But the decision between five and four stars was hard for me, I don't know why but it was, I decided that five stars was a bit dramatic for ANY game so that's why it's not five stars.

US	5	2016-06-28	2.2.0	Five stars, 10/10	Dragon Addiction	Best iOS game ever! The waiting times are not bad, the graphics are fun and stunning, and the battles are amazing! Get this game you won't be disappointed!

US	1	2016-06-28	2.2.0	33Ladybug	Don't waste your time	Cute game but the constant pop up ads are a source of interruption and irritation!  I don't mind watching an ad in exchange for gems, but interrupting game play just ruined it for me. The only reason this game even got one star from me, is because it's the only way my review can be posted.
US	5	2016-06-28	2.2.0	Ms,s,	The best app in history!	Best app ever in history I think,the things pop up and give tips for what defeats what!So cute dragons with great timing.I would give this app the most stars if I can,please make this so everyone in WORLD history likes it!Keep up the good work!
US	4	2016-06-28	2.2.0	Geckers85	Fun but...	"Loved this game at first but now it's getting to be more of a chore. Takes way too much food and money to level up one dragon. 
The lottery is a joke. When you think lottery you think life changing amount of something but 1500 food or maybe 3 scrolls if you are lucky. It takes me 400000 food to level up one dragon one level at this point and 12 scrolls to train one dragon one level up in its chosen ability. So there's that. 
Also the mines you fight so hard for get taken over basically every time you collect on them so you have to battle it out... again."

US	2	2016-06-28	2.2.0	Menolie	Great game but ads getting out of control	"The ads are getting increasingly invasive and much too frequent.  

This morning, before I could even click on anything, I had **2** ads pop up.  I opened the game initially - boom, ad.  I went to zoom the screen out so I could collect food, gold, anything, and boom, another ad that decided I had clicked it (since I had been trying to zoom out the game screen) so it went to my safari, causing me to have to close out of safari, and then to restart the game which refreshes anytime you go to any other screen even if because of these invasive ads."

US	5	2016-06-26	2.2.0	Mayor Cookie	DRAGONS	Dragons are one of my favorite mythical creatures and to be able to take care of one and train one is so cool!
US	3	2016-06-26	2.2.0	6licoricesticks	Ads ads ads	This game is great. There's a lot to do and you accumulate coins and gems fairly quickly but the ads are really annoying. You get video ads all the time. What I also don't understand is why they give you involuntary video ads when you can voluntarily watch them to get gems. It seems messed up. Other than that it's a great game!

US	5	2016-06-26	2.2.0	Ads,ads,ads	Too many ads	"The game is great!!! But there are too many ads!!! When i need to tap on something an ad pops out of nowhere and takes me to a website. You guys mad it so that you can skip the ads in 15 sec right? NOPE. The ads are 16 seconds and the timer for the ""skip"" starts at 15 seconds left in the ad! Sometimes i press the X in the picture ads and it STILLS takes me the a website. Pleas put less ads in your game"

US	3	2016-06-25	2.2.0	Hay.bear	It's alright	It's a fun game but it's ridiculous how much you have to spend on food and how little food you get considering that when your dragons get to higher levels they eat tons of food. It just feels like there forcing you to spend real money.
US	5	2016-06-25	2.2.0	G Man 77	Nice game	Loving the app. Great job
US	5	2016-06-25	2.2.0	Tonya Perez	So fun	I love the game
US	4	2016-06-25	2.2.0	Liepard22	Fun but a few flaws	This game is really fun but there are some problems. First off, there are to many game offers. Also every thing really good cost gems and you must pay for more gems. Another reason is that after a while every thing gets to easy, so all you will do is go collect, battle,breed and you'll be done. This is an awesome game but the problems need to be fixed!
US	5	2016-06-24	2.2.0	Purpleheyzz	Awesome	Kill time and have Pokemon like battles

US	1	2016-06-24	2.2.0	Mereditht72	Invasive ads!!	The pop up ads for this game are RIDICULOUS. Worse than any other game I've played. They pop up in between tasks to force you to open the ad which then goes to Safari and then to the App Store. There's literally an add every 15-30 seconds. On top of this, it takes far too long to upgrade things. One star is being generous.
US	5	2016-06-24	2.2.0	😺😺😺👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼	Dragon mania	Best game ever easy to use and so much fun.
US	2	2016-06-24	2.2.0	VeganGal	Fun...when you can play	This game constantly restarts or throws up advertising at the worst moments. Be prepared to lose energy because the game restarts itself just as you start a battle.
US	5	2016-06-24	2.2.0	Marty9196	Decent	Decent command and conquer style game if you like those build your forte combat type games you like this one
US	1	2016-06-24	2.2.0	knight2142	Too Many Ads	I can't play this game for 5 minutes without an ad popping up. I don't mind a few ads here and there, but this game totally removes me every single time an ad pops up. Game enjoyable, but can't have any immersion. It's now deleted.

US	4	2016-06-24	2.2.0	Mandypandy1030	Love it but...	I love this app sooo much! It is very fun and very addictive! But i think there are some flaws. 1. I dont like how you have to wait for a long time for alot of things 2. I hate how you have to get update packs where you have to free up storage in order to do battles past level 9  3. Im always running out of gems because everything costs alot of gems. Other than that I love this game and totally recommend it to anyone looking for a new game to play!😊😊😊
US	5	2016-06-23	2.2.0	Track life❤️	Dragon mania legends	I love this game so much it is awesome
US	2	2016-06-23	2.2.0	Nolanke	Ads ruin it	I really like this game, but the ads ruin it. I've deleted the game for this reason because I don't have the patience to wait out every ad. I've tried finding other games but there's nothing like it. I would pay for the game if it meant there would be no pop ups. I'm pretty sure other people would do the same. Why not create a no ad version?
US	2	2016-06-23	2.2.0	JosieoWo	Ads make it unplayable	"I always accidentally tap on advertisements when playing and it's super annoying and unnecessary.
No wonder why I stopped playing."

US	2	2016-06-22	2.2.0	GhoulakZ	This game is lame!!😠😠	Compared to dragonvale and dragon city this game stinks but could you improve it so the dragons all look different and unique and so you battle with boss dragons my bro got mr Popsicle and he is frustrated that he can't use it in battle and he spent SO MANY GEMS ON IT so please fix this
US	4	2016-06-22	2.2.0	Sky12501	Love it, but...	I have fallen in love with this game but there are adds every ten seconds, i swear! I will be moving my screen to check on my dragons and a add comes, then I'm taken to the site. So i have to reload the game multiple times. Please fix the add count or the just adds in general!

US	3	2016-06-22	2.2.0	Ash0717	Downfall	My kids play this game, but since they don't have Facebook to make friends to help them open gates...they are stuck.
US	5	2016-06-22	2.2.0	TanyaLeeAnn	Love it!	"I love the game. The dragons are really cute and it's really easy to learn how to play and to advance. The hardest part I've found is getting enough food to level up my dragons. Up to about level 12 the dragons are pretty cheap food wise to level up, but then it starts getting expensive and I either have to spend A LOT of my gold to grow the expensive foods, or keep growing the cheaper foods that don't produce as much and it seems to take forever to save up enough to level up. 
When I was in lower levers I used to have a lot of issues with the ads popping up like other people have said, but I actually haven't noticed any in a while now, so no complaints from me on that."

Like when I first open the game-ad, when I click to harvest food-ad, and when I get out of a battle-ad! Every time I do something in the game I get an ad. One time when I was playing I counted 18 ads in just like about 10 minutes!

OMG this game is the best but for some reason I go in then it show dragolandia then it takes me out of the game it started doing that today and I started playing yesterday! Over all I love this game but I had to take one star off because if this problem.
US	5	2016-06-21	2.2.0	QuetzalliQueen	Addicted to this game	This game is so fun to play and it gets you addicted.

US	2	2016-06-21	2.2.0	music10810	The adds make it impossible to really enjoy.	I love this game as a concept. However, the adds keep crashing the app, adds freeze on a black screen(and doesn't go away until you force quit), the adds make the screen lag so when you press a button on the screen an add will immediately pop up and open a new safari page for whatever the add is for. I really like the graphics and the game is really well thought out otherwise. It's such a shame the adds make it so impossible to play.

The game is good I was getting into it wen it crashed again.. I would like to keep playing it if this were not to happen."
US	2	2016-06-20	2.2.0	Noxrina	Problems	Its a cute game I like it, but every time I do two things such as collect or breed ads will pop up constantly. I cant play the game without an ad every time i click on a button.
US	4	2016-06-20	2.2.0	sprinklescute47	Sound	I like this game. It is very addicting and fun to play. The only concern is the sound. Instead of music, it is replaced by a muffled static noise. Please tell me how I can fix this. Thank you.
US	3	2016-06-20	2.2.0	DWProAudio	Very Fun but Major Bug!!	I started the game but as soon as I completed the tutorial, it completely started over the game. Since I enjoyed the game so much, I decided to try again. This time I made it a little farther but it eventually crashed and started over again!! I think I would really enjoy this game, but it just doesn't work. Please fix!!
US	3	2016-06-20	2.2.0	Ritsuka350	Love the game but...	This game is really fun. The only thing I can not stand is that every 5-15 minutes my game play is interrupted by ads. This is extremely annoying. I understand that it is the main way that money is made off the app, but still. The ads shouldn't be as frequent or there should be a certain action that triggers the ads. Over all the app is fun, just fix the frequency and times when the ads pop up. Then I will give the game five stars.
US	1	2016-06-20	2.2.0	Ahshfjfkskfnfhhdj123456789	It's okay	I love playing the game and all but I never get to it. The server never works and it always says retry I've already retried it 4 times today and have yet to play it. I also don't like all of the ads because once I click on one of those it logs me out and then my server stops working again. I love playing dragon games and I downloaded it to support another Youtuber in the event thing but it disappoints me that I'm not able to play it. I downloaded another dragon game that works ten times better than this one. It actually loads for me. I just hope the game makers can fix the server. They have lost a player because I can never even get to the game which is sad to say.
US	5	2016-06-19	2.2.0	Yuko Tamogachi	Epic!!!😄😄😄	I just love this game! I love dragons and this game incorporates it at the perfect limit! I heard this off of a youtuber and she said that it is fading money for an endangered animal. How kind! This game is, Epic!!!😄😄😄
US	4	2016-06-19	2.2.0	Fun fest	Advertisements	The game is actually pretty good I thought I was going to just get it in the lead it but it's actually a fun game except advertisements come like 24 seven at least every three minutes it gets annoying
US	5	2016-06-19	2.2.0	mikeythehillmane	still doesn't connect to Facebook (loading screen doesn't go thru)	this game still won't let me connect to my Facebook page!! it loads forever and never goes thru. please fix this so I can be sure that my game is safe!

US	5	2016-06-19	2.2.0	Dragon lover😍	Awesome	This is the best game I have ever played! But there is one flaw, why is there always so many quests? I know it makes the game more fun, but when ever I get in the game or finish a quest it gives me four more! Other than that it is the best game I have ever played!❤️

US	3	2016-06-19	2.2.0	A List Celeb	Keeps crashing	This game is a lot of fun. However I only got to play it for one day. Every time I try to open it after the first day it crashes immediately. Fix this bug please or I'm deleting app. It's wasting space on my phone

US	4	2016-06-18	2.2.0	KawwaiGirls	Very Fun but...	This game is awesome but there is too many adds every time when I finish a battle or action an add pops up and I have to do it all over again or it crashes please reduce the amount of adds if it has a little adds I'm fine with it thanks

US	5	2016-06-18	2.2.0	Awesomeperson1432	So far So good	"I just started playing yesterday and I love it I usually never really play games like these but @grav3yardgirl (on YouTube) said ""you should go download this game"" so I did and I really love it!"
US	5	2016-06-18	2.2.0	MegaSunshine	DragonML	This is by far the most addicting game I've ever played. The dragons are adorable, you always have something to do in the game, and it's fun battling other dragons! Great game!
US	5	2016-06-18	2.2.0	lennonalways	Addicting!	Cute and addicting tap tap game as I like to call them.

US	3	2016-06-18	2.2.0	KiLaSo	Kinda Fun	The game is pretty fun, the only problem I have with it is all the ads! Every few minutes a new ad pops up and maybe even a video. It's really annoying.
US	4	2016-06-18	2.2.0	The real real John	Love it	This game is a blast! The ads constantly popping up can get annoying though. But this game is really a ton of fun. I'd recommend it.

US	3	2016-06-18	2.1.0	SaMAnDEtHAn	Update or don't play at all	At first I was really loving the game!! And then it gave me the option to update or wait and I wanted to wait. But then two days later it wasn't giving me the option to wait to update. I want to play but don't want to update, so now I'm not even playing because I can't update it. You should really give someone the option instead of forcing the update. Maybe then I could play it more...

US	1	2016-06-17	2.2.0	Gracieheff	Eh.	This game has too many ads, it seems unable to play without ads popping up when I try to do most things.. It's just not understandable enough on how to get friends, the daily spin isn't working. It keeps not spinning, then giving me the same thing when I try to actually spin it.

US	5	2016-06-17	2.2.0	marianna is awesome	Swamp family strong	Everybody join team rhino so we can save the endangered rhinos if you join team rhino and we win then that means that the swamp family donated 28000 dollars to endangered rhinos

US	5	2016-06-17	2.2.0	Ttaayylloorrccaassppeerr	Amazing	Even though I just started this game like 20 minutes ago it is amazing I was wanted to do this by a youtuber, GlitterForever17 and the game is amazing
US	3	2016-06-17	2.2.0	MunchkinBraidy	Meh	THis game is extremely glitchy it crashes often and you lose your place. I don't believe it is a game you should run on a screen iPhone 6 or smaller the about of items that ring the side of the screen is quite intrusive. The game play is quite fun I just hope that the game programmers can fix the crashing. I enjoy the game play just fix the issues
US	5	2016-06-17	2.2.0	Ms.Dinosaur	Pretty good!	This game is pretty cool and I don't really have any complaints about the game!

US	4	2016-06-17	2.2.0	Wolfgirl	Love this game!	but would you mind getting rid of that Chiquita banana ad please?! It freezes my game when it appears without warning!!
US	4	2016-06-17	2.2.0	gabsteruny	Game	Great game so far...
US	3	2016-06-17	2.2.0	Riyu ^~^	Bugs!	I like this game because it's similar to other facebook games. FarmVille etc. however it's has too many bugs! The ads come up and make the game unplayable it completely stops the game and I have to close and reopen the app in order to keep playing. I don't mind having ads in general but if they stop my gameplay I'll just have to play a different game.
US	5	2016-06-17	2.2.0	The one named me	Very nice	I really love this app and so will you if you love dragons. It's way better than all he other dragon games I have played. So if you want a good review here is one.
US	5	2016-06-17	2.2.0	🤔🙄can't find l d	Doesn't get old	"I just bought this app. It's very interesting I have never seen an app with this format quite like this, though I feel I won't ever tire of this type of game. The game does make it quite hard to expand your ""realm"" but other than that I have no problems this app is pretty great!"
US	3	2016-06-16	2.2.0	#dragonsRule	Update!	Can I have an update for it?im getting bored of the same old
US	5	2016-06-16	2.2.0	E.Revis	Dragon mania	"Love it.  Enjoy the new dragons, though some are hard to get.  My grandson found this game and we play it together. Hope it continues for a long time. Need more friends.
Need to make getting friends easier."
US	5	2016-06-16	2.2.0	Cool h2oguy	Cool game	Is a cool game  to play  and I hope I get all of them.😎👌✌️
US	1	2016-06-16	2.2.0	MiuSan	Ads - lots and lots of ads	"My daughter loves watching the dragons and feeding them. Animation is also good.

What we don't like is the amount of ads - lots and lots of them. Every minute or so sometimes an ad after a few actions an ad. Not just the full page image that takes too long to load but video ones that last 15 -30 seconds. I understand why publishers use ads but this is overkill. 

Add the fact that any event requires premium Currancy to complete just gives the feeling that these are money hungry developers that push the micro transaction and ads too far. 

Could have been 5 stars with its content - but instead it's 1 from the jarring ad experience"
US	5	2016-06-16	2.2.0	Alseep	👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻	Very fun and enjoyable
US	5	2016-06-16	2.2.0	Olivia puppy lover	I love this game	I love battling dragons  and getting more amazing super cool dragons I ♥️ this game!
US	5	2016-06-16	2.2.0	DRAGONMANIALEGENDS lover	Best game ever	Thxs for the game it has been better than Minecraft so that is why I give this a five star rating ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌟
US	5	2016-06-16	2.2.0	Ally(: :P	I love this!	Its really cool. And a great way to end the day
US	5	2016-06-16	2.2.0	Gracegirl710	Love this game and I'm also new	The only thing I found out yet is when the spin is up the record thing won't move so I can't get out of that screen
US	5	2016-06-16	2.2.0	Ros7381	Great surprise	I really like this game so far. I heard about this game through grav3yardgirl on you tube. I'm addicted to it already. I love all my dragons!
US	4	2016-06-16	2.2.0	Marissa of the sea	Good	It's a great game
US	5	2016-06-16	2.2.0	The SIayer	Fantastic Game	I love DML. Not only is it addicting, but it's fun, too. Maybe create more dragons so people don't get bored of the same dragons. To have fun you either need VIP or need to buy gems, and for people who can't do either of those...it's not that entertaining. Overall this is a great game and I've loved playing it over the last two months. Keep it up!
US	4	2016-06-15	2.2.0	Dreamr101	Great game.	I love this game. I just wish instead of having to pay for every little thing they could just make the app 1.99 or something also if you could send other people dragons. Maybe in a update in the future.
US	5	2016-06-15	2.2.0	Ricargonza	A mi niña le encantan los dragones.	Es un juego muy entretenido
US	1	2016-06-15	2.2.0	H ow about that	Disappointing	After seeing all the commercials and hype, I am very disappointed with this game.. It is extremely confusing on how to get friends, unable to get daily prizes. Multiple glitches in game. My dragons appear black with question marks in then. My farms shut off constantly. Ottos wheel does not spin for prizes it just gives you a diamond. And on and on it goes.
US	5	2016-06-15	2.2.0	Diablillo40	Addicted game	My kid and my self are so into this game, is very entertain and cool at the same time. We have spent a lot of time together trying to hatch and raise many dragon and when we get those legendary one that's the best.
US	5	2016-06-15	2.2.0	Chancecarver64	Awesome	Love the game very fun to play
US	2	2016-06-15	2.2.0	JLWA	Could be great but	The ad interruptions are ridiculous.  I might be incline to purchase items but they are ridiculously expensive and also not in my local currency, so a double whammy.  I will not pay 79 British pounds to buy a dragon and some gems for a virtual game.
US	4	2016-06-15	2.2.0	Carlos Anqel	Yasssd	This game is absoultley amazing i lovee it so much. Just wish things were a little cheaper coin wise and the ads are getting annoying coming on whenever you click something.
US	5	2016-06-15	2.2.0	Change purse	Fun	Great game, but the surprise pop up ads are pretty terrible.

US	1	2016-06-15	2.2.0	horse42	Bugs and ads	I like this game a lot but there were a lot of bugs and ads kept popping up and I wanted the ads to stop popping up also it kept losing my progress other then that I like it but I didn't see a way to make the ads go away if there is a way to make the ads go away for good I would love to know that

US	4	2016-06-15	2.2.0	Mcell85	Crashes often	Fun to play, but loses connection and crashes often.
US	4	2016-06-15	2.2.0	FrodoBaggins43	FrodoBaggins43	Fun game so far
US	5	2016-06-15	2.2.0	Ditzybug207	Super fun!	I love this game so much!  Something I get really frustrated about with other games similar to this is that you reach a point that you can't go any farther without buying a bunch of stuff with real money.  I've been playing this one for about 6 months now and there's still so much for me to do. There are options of extra things you can buy but it doesn't force you to if you want to move on in the game which is something I love!  The graphics are fantastic!  The dragons are so cute!  My only complaint is that the sounds are really strange. They just don't fit with the game, but I mainly play with the sound off so it's not a big deal.  Other than that, I can't say enough good about this game!
US	4	2016-06-14	2.1.0	Xith	Alright	It's an ok game wish you could move your habitats and buildings around to organize though
US	5	2016-06-14	2.1.0	Jkhamada	Amazing game	This game is amazing! 5/5 stars! Everything from the graphics to gameplay itself, it's all incredible!
US	5	2016-06-14	2.1.0	Cricket1966	Cool	Cool game
US	4	2016-06-14	2.1.0	Robb203	Fun	This game is really fun , it's a lil pricey but what game isn't now-a-days . The only thing that bothers me is the ads , there's no warning it pops up randomly and most of the time I accidentally click on the ad .
US	4	2016-06-14	2.1.0	Aquaticikl	Really Awesome	I love the game, thought it would be to childish but I was wrong. The only reason it gets a four is because it is a build and wait type game and I don't like waiting😂.
US	3	2016-06-14	2.1.0	Arianna846	All 30 dragons lost	I am incredibly upset right now.i had played this game for a couple of years and was up to level eight teen with 30 dragons. Now because i downloaded this update, I lost my dragons and I was sent back to level six with no dragons whatsoever. Please fix this. I loved playing this game but one day I just updated it and lost everything like candy dragon mr Popsicle and so on so hopefully you fix it plz
US	1	2016-06-13	2.1.0	Bid piano	I enjoyed the game but this is the last straw! 😡	I loved the graphics and all the battling but the ads coming out of NO WHERE and the fact that it can't even download right, I hade enough of it. I deleted it and I will never get the game as long as I live. The game is good but with the constant ads, (yes, it occurs in the fights making it frustrating.) I've had enough of it. If the creators of the game see this, here's a thought for y'all, STOP IT WITH THE ADS COMING OUT OF NO WHERE! It's driving me crazy(not to mention everyone else)
US	5	2016-06-13	2.1.0	Drea is cool	Awesome	This game is cool and really fun to play. It's definitely a keeper
US	5	2016-06-13	2.1.0	Strumpeta	Addicting	"I wasn't going to get this at first but then I was just like ""eh, why not?"" Now I'm addicted to it and I'm constantly checking on my dragons!"
US	4	2016-06-13	2.1.0	Matt se	Ad's	Love the game but way to much ad's
US	2	2016-06-13	2.1.0	Wefarmasmidgen	Dragon mania legends	"I give up!  I realize ads are necessary, but the excessive ads in this game make it difficult to play at all.  None of the other ""free"" games I play and enjoy have anywhere near the number of ads and interruptions of this one.  Some of us do not have unlimited bandwidth, and so many ads eats up too much of what I have.  So...goodbye Dragon Mania."
US	5	2016-06-12	2.1.0	D ROD 50	Vary fun	Love this game it's vary
US	5	2016-06-11	2.1.0	XxKittyLoafxX	Love it!! Find codes to receive rewards!	"Enter code d166f to receive a reward! To enter code, tap on the lighthouse and the right icon. 

Very addictive! Ads can sometimes be annoying but overall very fun!"

US	5	2016-06-11	2.1.0	(Lady O)	Cute but awesome	They are cute in the beginning but in the end they are very cool!
US	5	2016-06-11	2.1.0	This games is AWESOME!!!!! :)	STOP COMPLAINING	You haters need to stop whining and complaining like little kids throwing a tantrum, keep your OWN problems to YOURSELF, the makers can't keep up with this , they want you to have FUN, NOT to complain and whine about one LITTLE THING IN THE GAME, maybe YOUR device just isn't compatible, and besides, if you don't like the game, JUST DELETE IT. It's ok if you write a review on something, but just DONT COMPLAIN. Anyways, I LOVE THIS GAME, it is AWESOME, the graphics are amazing and this is by far the best dragon game ever!!
US	2	2016-06-10	2.1.0	Old rpger	Pop up ads and expensive upgrades	I've only been playing this for a day, but this game has forced me out before I can really get into it.  I'm patient enough to handle long waits, but unavoidable un-skip able ads popping up without warning is too much to take.  Add to that pricey upgrades to necessary buildings, and I just can't play any more.
US	4	2016-06-10	2.1.0	RayGunMarklll	Ok	It a good game really fun actually but there's one thing..... WHY level 25 to unlock the clan castle I mean that's SO HARD TO DO!!!
US	1	2016-06-10	2.1.0	Find butt Ava	Horrible Game 😡😤	When I'm trying to take care of my dragons it always starts playing an ad.
US	4	2016-06-10	2.1.0	Airis123	I like it	I love the game and the battles. I also like how I get to throw the food.

US	3	2016-06-10	2.1.0	Keyshib	Hmm	Okay it's a good game ... Great game .. But we really could go without the ads popping up randomly and what not
US	2	2016-06-09	2.1.0	Jaliah13	TOO MANY CRASHES	I love the game and its alot of fun however the game is always crashing, especially in the middle of a battle. I can barely be on the app for 60seconds before it closes out and restarts.  PLEASE FIX ASAP!!!!!!
US	2	2016-06-09	2.1.0	Mayday2000	Was fun, but...	Very enjoyable and addictive at first, playing for many months.  Would gladly pay a token amount to support the game, but not the insane usury amounts for trivial items, from $10 to $50 or more!  And now the ads, almost every minute, or less! And who the heck is your target audience, showing performance car ads or city tourism propaganda to a children's game?  Or NASCAR ads over and over on the Microsoft mobile platform? And of course, the random crashes...  Ironically, now even the ads can crash the game.  Time to move on folks, nothing to see here.  Be warned before you invest to much time or money in this ad driven product...
US	5	2016-06-09	2.1.0	Spiritwolf12	Amazing!!	"This game is awesome, a must-have!! The graphics are great, the ads are limited and the dragons are amazing. It doesn't take too much work to level up your dragons and the breeds are countless. I only have a few suggestions for the game.

- Technically, a dragon without wings is just a fire-breathing dinosaur. The game would be slightly more realistic is wings were added to ALL the dragons.

- Make the other islands easier to unlock and take off the limits on habitat building. 

- Question: I'm so confused! The Winner's Circle looks useless but sells for like a million dollars! Is it just a rare decoration or does it actually have a purpose??😖😱

Thanks for reading!!"

US	5	2016-06-05	2.1.0	aeb_4	Awesome!!!!	I love this game because of how cute the baby dragons are and how much suspense there is!!
US	5	2016-06-05	2.1.0	CrystalCereal	Awseome!	Cool kid friendly game and better than most dragon games I've played
US	4	2016-06-05	2.1.0	<3 YES <3	Please Remove Thanks 😊	Love the game but seriously the advertisements are annoying they pop up to much it's seriously unnecessary makes me want to stop playing in the middle of doing something the advertisements pop up and I accidentally click on it please remove especially when I'm battling and it's not like I'm getting my energy back use them when it's appropriate seriously ready to delete
US	5	2016-06-04	2.1.0	Heat1221	Not fun	WAAAAAAAAAAAAY to many ads, every couple of seconds an ad would pop up pulling you away
US	5	2016-06-04	2.1.0	Chloeclark357	The best game ever	AWESOME GAME
US	5	2016-06-04	2.1.0	K1ttyf1st3r	Fun but...	Add pop-ups, they pop up every time you do anything
US	4	2016-06-04	2.1.0	Creeperbiscuit	Great game, but a couple problems.	First of all, THE ADS. I'm in  the middle of something and they'll just randomly pop up out of nowhere, it's so annoying. Also if my phone goes into sleep mode with the app up then I'll have to reboot my game. Then there's the cuteness. I like how they made it cute but it's just that they made it too cute. They could've at least made it a bit more realistic. There's also the waiting. To build, upgrade, and farm things you have to wait so long. What am I going to do for ten hours while I wait to build a simple structure. I mean I understand 30 secs but 10 HOURS! That's insane! My dragons also start wanting attention at 3 in the morning. Other than that I've had no problems, I think it's a pretty good game.
US	2	2016-06-03	2.1.0	ghdillon	An Ad-gravating Experience	It's a cute time-waster, but the ads constantly popping up to interfere with the gameplay was what made me uninstall this game.
US	5	2016-06-03	2.1.0	Lilith Whalen	Love it	I love dragons so this is the right game for me
US	3	2016-06-03	2.1.0	Blonde.thinkpink	Fun game but too many crashes	Fun game but crashes quite a bit disrupting game data saved and playing the game.
US	1	2016-06-03	2.1.0	Nauticaled	30g of memory? Um no!	I used to play this game all the time and loved it until this stupid update. I always update it and enjoy my collection of dragons. However this recent update prevents me from seeing many of my dragons. It puts a question mark across them and in order for me to pet them or feed them or even see them I have to download more and more extensions. If I did it for all my dragons it would take 32 gigs of space?!?! NOT MB! IT SAYS GIGABYTES! Oh hail to the naw. Too many ads and gems too pricey anyway. I've invested plenty of money in this game but no more!!! Adios dragon mania...uninstalled
US	3	2016-06-01	2.1.0	gamingwonton	Love the game, but waaaay too many ads	Really enjoy the overall game mechanics, but there are so many freaking ads. I'm hoping this app saves my data, because it didn't save switching to iOS.
US	5	2016-06-01	2.1.0	aaaaaaaaaok	cute!	only just started, but the dragons are so cute! i always miss when i'm tossing them food though, so they have to turn around and look for it. honestly, it's the little things like that that make me smile most.
US	5	2016-06-01	2.1.0	Pony Rainbow Flower	Better than expected	I just got this game today and I am impressed! I have been playing dragon vale for a while and my brother suggested it. I suggest you should get the game.

US	5	2016-06-01	2.1.0	Kewl1213	Addictive	Love it😎
US	2	2016-06-01	2.1.0	Silvershoe2015	Crashes and Ads	I used to enjoy this game, but after the last few  updates, there has been nothing but ads and crashes.  They come every couple minutes and sometimes, but not very often, they come during a battle.  You never know when it will crash.  If it crashes during a battle in the arena or in a dungeon, you loose one of your tokens. Since each dragon has a maximum of 3 tokens each in the dungeon, you automatically loose 3 tokens.  One for each dragon, you use on your team.  I can understand the need for ads, but if you are going to give us ads every two minutes then give us something for our trouble.  There is a balloon where you can get different prizes for watching an ad, but nothing for watching an ad every 2-3 minutes.  I was told to reinstall the app to fix the crashes, but that didn't work.  Gameloft never responded about all the ads we get.  They still get paid from all the ads we see.  They only care about the money they get.  They don't care about the players.  Until these problems get fixed, I don't recommend this game.
US	5	2016-06-01	2.1.0	BenjaminGaming360	I love this game	As a gamer I have played lots of games on my phone, and out of all those games this is one of my all time favorites. The game has a great plot! Raise, train, and battle dragons to become a master. Every time I play I feel as if I have a strong bond with my dragons that only grows stronger and stronger and stronger. To the makers of this game I say this... Thank you!
US	1	2016-05-31	2.1.0	zakdarak	Ads...	This game is awesome. Its pretty. Its well done. Its unique. But holy MOLY the ads... every ten seconds man, literally

US	1	2016-05-30	2.1.0	Ktkoneko	Impossible to play	I get ads for free games. I do. But they pop up every 5-10 seconds (not exaggerating) and take forever to load. Then the skip in countdown may read at 15 seconds, but stalls and drags on the entire duration of 30+ second ads. It's a fun game to pass time, but it's absolutely impossible to play with the ads they've set up.
US	5	2016-05-30	2.1.0	K$k$k$	😍👍🏻	😍👍🏻
US	5	2016-05-30	2.1.0	Blindshade	Amazing	I had this game for about a few months now and I am still have so much fun.this game is fun to me since you can raise your own dragons,and play with friends,battle people,and much much more.you even have a chance to get dragons that need so many jems just by breeding high leveled dragons!its a really fun game to play when you are bored.
US	5	2016-05-30	2.1.0	Springstar1374	AWESOME	I love this game!! So much fun, takes time away from you(in a good way)!!!!!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
US	4	2016-05-30	2.1.0	Doggirl4reals345	It's good but...	Ok so all the battles are so fun and I love them but I tryed to buy a in app purchase and it said error code and so I tryed again and it ended up charging my parents 14 bucks that's silly and bad so that's the only bad thing😟😟😟😟😟😟
US	1	2016-05-30	2.1.0	Ilikepiemlg	Dragon LAMEia legends	"Lame! The customer support is awful. They just want money. Also the dragons look stupid. Heck! Most don't even have wings! It has to have wings or else this is basically a ""cute"" Ark Survival Evolved. Speaking of cute, dragons and wyverns aren't supposed to look cute! They're supposed to look scary or cool. Also, the mechanics: aren't dragons supposed to fly while fighting? Oh wait, HALF OF THEM DONT HAVE WINGS! The logic is absolutely TERRIBLE! For example, that ugly smoke dragon for noobs, should breath smoke,not fire or wind! AND, sunflower dragons are strong against fire. That makes no sense what so ever! Doesn't fire BURN PLANTS? I may be overreacting. It's just a game, but STILL! This is complete crap. The gameplay is poor, too. Also this game is way too easy. You don't even need gems to win. Another thing I wanted to say was ads! Ads! Ads! Ads! Btw, stop saying AD ME!AD ME! It's very annoying and its only gonna make me less likely to add you. I don't even know why I still play this constantly evolving garbage. I will  definitely move on from this junk."

US	1	2016-05-28	2.1.0	Booo345678	You have to be kidding.	I just hit level 15, and then an ad pops up even before I was even able to collect the prize. Every two minutes, another ad. The game is getting old fast. It is unfortunate, because there were elements of the game that were  pretty fun. Leveling your dragons, leveling farms, leveling your nest. It's too bad for all the ads. I'm sure I will MoveOn fairly soon.
US	3	2016-05-28	2.1.0	Hgfhtygeyggbvbbhhgyghhg	Needs a update	Make breeding and hatching dragons faster PLEASE!!! And make something that tells you what dragons make what type of eggs! I will sponsor you for free if you update what I tell you to do please! And make trading dragons possible and make trading like 1,500 gold for 8 gems! Around 18 people quit playing because of these matters! I will make people join if this update does happen! Thank you!
US	4	2016-05-28	2.1.0	Dyetrooo	Dragooooons!!	Very fun game! Nice graphic and gameplay. I just hope it's not too expensive to buy gems.. That's why 1 star is missing. Overall it's 9/10. Would recommend to everyone.

US	4	2016-05-27	2.1.0	Hadheartscats	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!!	The dragons are so adorable and it is so fun to battle and feed them. I have been looking for a game like this :) but...there is only one issue...THE ADS!!!!

Want to point out.  MAKE MORE RARE  
DRAGONS!!!!! There's more epics then 
Rares, you might as well take rares out of
The game"
US	3	2016-05-27	2.1.0	SilverLocust	Fun, but best with Facebook	I love the fact this game is a hybrid of a lot of the popular games out there (dragonvale,Pokemon, etc) what I don't like is without a Facebook account you can't get friends which are needed for some things. I got my son playing we compete to breed dragon's etc. I want him to be able to friend adults I know - I don't think he should have to be on Facebook to enjoy the full game. I can't give a game that makes full access contingent on social media accounts a 5 star.
US	5	2016-05-26	2.1.0	Nunusouhhh	👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽	I love this game but adding friends is tricky. Add me and visit my dragon land 🤗🤗🤗 (a884c9)

US	5	2016-05-26	2.1.0	Cemjcmknm	Awesome Game	I am addicted to this game. It's bad when you wake up in the night to hatch a new dragon !!!!
US	5	2016-05-26	2.1.0	Trithaithus	Love it!	I love games like this!! The dragons are cute and the gameplay is fun and relaxing. And the fact you do not need to pay to progress in the game is very nice. I've played others where it felt like you had to pay to advance at all. You can choose to purchase the bonuses but it is not necessary by any means. Definitely recommend!!!
US	3	2016-05-26	2.1.0	LiaLight	Ads Upon Ads Upon Ads😡😤	I only ever write reviews if I'm irritated with something. So. Here: The ONLY problem I have so far with this game/app (over the last year I believe) ads. Now, before all these lovely little updates (maybe starting a few months ago) they were okay. But now? They get it my way, mess up what I'm doing, and so on. Now I understand you need them for people who don't pay. I get that am I'm fine with it. But. Is there way to put them on the bottom of the screen? Because not only will we get to see this, still have them, but we will want to play more of YOUR game/app. I love it, I truly do, but it's getting to the point to where I don't even want to open this thing with those popping up ever 2 minutes. Please try moving them off to the side. As I said, I understand they need to be there, but they don't need to seriously be in the middle of the freaking screen.~ I'll update this when it gets fixed.

US	1	2016-05-23	2.1.0	Bbea2046	Used to be fun but............	This game used to be fun but once you get to a higher level, the amount of food and gold to feed dragons are just RIDICULOUS, and its almost impossible to breed certain dragon doesnt matter how many times you tried! Starting to be a waste of time with this game!
US	5	2016-05-23	2.1.0	Stephan_Irle	Agree w/Coolie in all points	"The game is really fun and we now play it almost every day. The frequent internet requests can indeed be mildly annoying, especially since the new upgrade came out.  5 stars.

Update: Now reached level 90 but they manage to keep the game interesting, for instance with the clans and castle challenge.  Cool stuff!"
US	5	2016-05-22	2.1.0	Gdrxrbbhnhnh	SO CUTE	I love this game!!!All the dragons are cute and they are so cool.Some times the cool and cute dragons are the strongest.Any way this game is the best.All the people that have a phone,iPad or whatever should have this game.This game really deserves a 5 star.😍

US	2	2016-05-22	2.1.0	Bigalbat	In game ads...	The in game ads really blow... I understand trying to get you to buy gems but they force 15 second commercials on you. Very inconvenient. Leave it as an option to get gems like other games not force me to watch an ad when I collect gold.
US	2	2016-05-22	2.1.0	CommercialHater	Loading....	Sometimes the game says that when I'm loading I'm not connected tot the internet which i am and it never loads
US	5	2016-05-22	2.1.0	abaublitz	Super fun	"Similar to Dragon Story but much more fun and it isn't impossible to get gems either! Only complaint is that the ads get kind of annoying and whenever I go to the gem balloon, it often says that there are no videos available for me to watch.
Other than that, the game is very fun and I enjoy playing it. It's a nice way to spend a lazy hour."
US	3	2016-05-22	2.1.0	Scarlettt19	What's with all the ads?! 😟🙁☹️😕😶😦	This is a great game but what is with all the ads? When I started playing the game before the recent update, the game was great with very few ads but now there's an ad every 2 seconds and sometimes it even gets stuck on it too, the ads are making it annoying and not as fun to play. I would give the game 5 stars but the ads are ridiculous.

and has very nice gameplay it 
shows great potential as a
game"
US	4	2016-05-20	2.1.0	UNSC Orac 117	Decent game, tvOS issues	"Having played it for awhile, it seems like a decent game. However, there appear to be some technical issues. First, some of the UI controls seem ""inconsistent"", such as when you're trying to select dragons for breeding; works fine on the left side, but the right side sometimes switches between selection and scrolling - while using the same controller input (D-pad) - *while* trying to make a selection. Secondly, there appear to be random disconnects, which don't occur in other games (Gameloft or otherwise), for which customer support offers the usual ""see if it's on your end"" - and then that's where the conversation/support ends.

Separately and unrelated to my rating, it would be nice if there was something else to do with your dragons other than the combat grind; perhaps that's all this is intended to be."

US	3	2016-05-19	2.1.0	Lisaabby	Fun but frustrating	I've only had this game for a week, but so far it seems pretty good. But I've noticed that random ads and banners pop out of nowhere. The higher the level your dragons are in, the better they fight, but by the time your dragon gets to level 10 you must have 500 fruits to feed them! Also when you upgrade or buy new buildings from the store it takes hours and hours(the longest I've seen so far is 10 hours) the fights are super fun, and I love breeding dragons, but there is a lot wrong with the game, and eventually I'm sure it will just frustrate me to death.
US	2	2016-05-18	2.1.0	 mermaid	Cute at first...	Cute game at first, until they start trying to force you to buy in-game items just to PROGRESS. Do not get if you hate FREEMIUM games, cause that is exactly what this scam of an app this is!

US	2	2016-05-18	2.1.0	BunnyBloody	Ok	The game is ok but for some reason I can't battle or pet some of my dragons. I've tried to download them but it keeps telling me that I don't have enough space on my device when I've got plenty of space.
US	3	2016-05-18	2.1.0	Jennyoson	Fun	It is fun, but the random advertisements every ten minutes make it not worth it. I want to play a game without having to be interrupted so often.
US	1	2016-05-18	2.1.0	Britsara	It was fun, at first	It's fun playing this game when you're bored and you have some free time. The problem is they make you wait time limits to when stuff is done. Doesn't usually matter since I'm not always playing the game. Another thing is that when you battle the dragon bosses that are lower leveled i.e. 13- why are they able to take out my level 17 dragons in one hit. I mean make the game reasonable, and if your going to make bosses that are such low in level so good then you need to give the opportunity to wait less time for food or lower the amount of food dragons eat when they are higher levels, I mean come on in one day I can make 1,500 food / 12 hr since I believe this is the smartest way for me to go. I get about 30,000 food a day except to feed my level 17 dragon ONCE it costs 6,250... A fifth? That's insane. I can feed him 5 times in one day! And that's just one dragon! It's a joke really. But it's fun until you start to actually get good and play the game, then it becomes rotten and a waste of time.

I can deal with banner ads...but the pop up and open a window/video that will cause my game to reload when I return, which is irritating. Some of the video ads just glitch out too, and crash my game.

The new events are fun, but I won't enjoy them as much because 4-6 ads over the course of 10min (if that) of gameplay is absurd when I have to reload at least half the time. :/"

US	3	2016-05-16	2.1.0	LauraNAdam	What is up with the ads?!?!	I too have been sucked in to the world of the dragons! I've been playing it for a few weeks now and have had no issues! But, the last two days the random ads ( and even the ones from Otto's) keep freezing on an advertising screen. The screen remains black and says advertisement or the little countdown in the corner and then I have to force close and restart. It wouldn't be so bad if it were just Otto's ads. I'd deal. But, the random ads that pop up throughout the game are doing it and it is insanely annoying! Please fix!!

US	5	2016-05-09	2.1.0	ThatOneDragonLady	Awesome game	Definitely worth getting into.  Not high maintenance, but yet exciting enough to keep your attention for awhile. Well worth the free download!
US	5	2016-05-09	2.1.0	amjoie	Great fun!	"I have been thoroughly enjoying myself for the last month with this great game. The breeding of dragons is what I find the most enjoyable, although I have learned to fight battles, on my own terms, as well. You can do as little or as much fighting as you want, and still advance in the game.

I have chosen to invest in this game, by becoming a level 6 VIP. You are able to play the game without that, of course. But being a VIP has huge advantages, and makes it possible to more easily win some event dragons.

If battling is your primary focus you will most likely find you need to spend some real money to get dragons leveled up to the highest levels, quickly. But if you are willing to take your time -- lots of time -- then it is entirely possible to play the game without investing real money. Just not as much fun. ;)

Events run all the time that allow for as much competition as you can handle. Some are about breeding and some about feeding, gathering coins, etc.

Weekly and monthly breeding opportunities give you specialty dragons, if you like the offerings. I have bred some and skipped some. But the more, the merrier, because larger numbers mean more available coin each harvest.

I think this game will hold my interest for a very long time, because there is always something fun and challenging to do."

I love this game above all others I've played. Granite the game has some issue's that need to be still worked out within the game, with time that too will come. What I would really like to see is more new Island's that the gamers can purchase. Plus maybe another hatchery and another breeding den. Is it possibility for this to happen with in the game??????????

Thank You

US	5	2016-05-05	2.1.0	MercyPi	Blunt🍁Honesty	I've never written a review for an app before but it's 2am and it said the dragons needed feedback. This game fulfills my desires, you have dragons who give you gold when they are happy and who you use to fight, you buy them stuff with gold, you make baby dragons. Drawback I see that stands out is that it just takes a lot of data, to keep progressing you have to keep downloading more stuff. But I enjoy it a lot, as a 19 year old with probably better things to do. If you are looking for something kind of farmville-like with dragons then you should indulge in dragon mania legends.

US	1	2016-05-04	2.1.0	Kissthis591	Fun but it doesn't work	The stupid game is addicting and I played it on my other device but I cannot link devices because it says that doesn't have the right code even though it's exactly correct. I would like that to be fixed and then I would give it a better score. But otherwise I would give it a one star and if we can give it a lower score I would. I hope the makers of this game read this and fix it as soon as possible so I can put on my other device.

US	5	2016-05-04	2.1.0	Tridddles	Great Fun!	"My wife has been playing this game for several months so I finally broke down and decided to install it on my phone. Originally I was worried about everyone who says that advertisements get in the way. But I found that if you simply buy the initial starter pack for like $1.99 when the game offers it, it somehow turns off all the ads as they haven't popped up on my phone in over two days now.

I'm definitely looking forward to becoming addicted to this new game!"
US	5	2016-05-04	2.1.0	YoshiKooply	Facebook	Everything about this game so far for me is flawless. Petting your dragons is an adorable feature, the battles are ACTUALLY FUN, I love the animation and voices! But herein lies the problem- Facebook. I have waited literally 2 hours for my game to connect but it never works. Please do something about this in the next update, I and many others would greatly appreciate it😇
US	3	2016-05-04	2.1.0	Reberose22o2	Super fun..... But....	This game is sooo much fun but could use a few adjustments like not making everything take so long, and it costs way to much food to level the dragons up enough so you can actually win some fights the farther you go on the map, and more nests would be great also another breeding den!!!! And the clam for gems is NEVER open :( and a monarch dragon would be amazing!!!! Of those things were fixed and made better this would be the PERFECT game!!!!
US	3	2016-05-04	2.0.3	MaruAru	Great Game	I really enjoy playing this game. You can breed, raise, and fight dragons. The only thing that is annoying are the ads in the middle of the game. I accidentally click them or I have to wait for a video. Sometimes I have to wait for a video and after when I want to watch a video so I can spin the wheel, there are no videos available to watch. Overall, it's fun if you like turn-based games with timing.

Says I can watch videos to get gems, yet is always says ""Sorry, no videos available"". I haven't been able to watch a single video. Just a lot of bugs that need to get fixed."
US	1	2016-05-02	2.0.3	The ad game	"""Ad-sessive"""	Terrible. The game has been taken over by very aggressive ads and I can't spend more than a few seconds without accidentally pressing one. Btw, it takes over your whole screen with no warning. Such a shame. This game used to be fun.

US	2	2016-05-01	2.0.3	artistfloor9	Terrible Ads	The game itself is great. I've been playing for over a year now, but the amount of ads and the way in which they appear are getting completely out of hand. The game is borderline unplayable now. An ad pops up literally every 2-5 minutes without warning, it makes the game lag, and because it takes up the entire screen, it tricks you into clicking on it just as you are about to click on something else, which of course forces you to exit the game. This is ridiculous and needs to be fixed.
US	4	2016-04-30	2.0.3	Kyle Schmock	Fun but things to work on.	This game is so fun to play ! But you are only allowed to put in one recruitment code for friends. So I would advise an update with more than one recruitment code allowed.

How is it fair that I start a battle and am interrupted by a coke ad and I lose my turn? Are you kidding me? This game doesn't reload or refresh for anything, so every time YOU interrupt my gameplay I lose something and can't get it back. Thank goodness I wasn't stupid enough to spend any money on this game! Go back to no ads!

US	1	2016-04-15	2.0.3	Pescetti19	Too many ads	Game is fun, but there are way too many ads. Constantly come up during game play. Extremely annoying
US	1	2016-04-15	2.0.3	Silvers3	Good game BUT	"Update: The popup ads have gotten worse I'm not in the game 2min & I'm bombarded by 3 15sec ads. This is a bit much for ANY game & is really trying my patience. Constant problems in game & can't contact customer service because it's broken as well. They really need to stop with the ads every 2min and fix the game. 

With all the constant popup ads in game, crashing when you goto post on Facebook & constant loss of progress I'm only giving the game 2 stars. If they get rid of the ads that popup about every 5-10 min, I'd give it a higher rating. As it's really hard to make progress in the game with the ads popping up all the time even during battles which cause you to loose said battle."

US	5	2016-04-14	2.0.3	Bearbear3906	Amazing	I think that this is an awesome game and I would play it for hours
US	5	2016-04-13	2.0.3	Snoppy47	Great game	Love this game ive played for around two months now and am addicted. Now in response to #9 you cant build any habitats because youve built too many habitats in general. You need to lvl up or delete existing habitats in order to keep building.

US	4	2016-04-11	2.0.3	APimpnamedslickb	Dragon Mania Legends	"I like the game , but the amount of gems for some of the dragons are astronomical and the money needed to expand is insane. I understand it can't be super cheap but 150 gems or 3 mil in coins is a bit much for an 8yr and 6yr old ( my children ) revisit the prices or allow players to earn more by completing in game tasks without me having to shell out a paycheck 

Sincerely , 
A dedicated dad"
US	1	2016-04-11	2.0.3	Happy15Panda	Too many ads	Can't play the game when every 10 seconds you get pulled out for an ad you didn't hit. Game is okay, except for the part where they want you to  pay to advance.

US	3	2016-04-09	2.0.3	spence377	Decent game could be great	Good game. Could be a great game if it would stop playing a video every 15-30 seconds, give how to breed  with every dragon info, and a few other things that needs tweaking.

Be more creative!"

US	1	2016-04-05	2.0.3	Griffenatoir	Stop auto play ads	DON'T give the option to watch ads for gems and then play auto ads every 5 minutes of play time, maybe save money from your ads instead of paying for worthless commercials
US	4	2016-04-05	2.0.3	Random productions	It's pretty good but	I love dragon mania legends its really fun and awesome. It gives something to do when I'm bored but lately I have had glitches on the game. For example I save up 2.79 million coins and then after I go to battle the game says I have 2.8 million. Also there have been a lot of adds on the game . If you fix the glitches maybe I will give the game 5 stars.because it has happened to me more than once

US	2	2016-04-05	2.0.3	Shortbunny	Tired of commercials	I like this game but commercials always popping up and interfering with my game play is getting old.
US	4	2016-04-05	2.0.3	E cats 55	It was great!	"I love this game and all that it has to give! I like to do it my spare time. I am on level 24 and I live that the game gives updates. I love that the game is fun and amazing. The designs are great and the dragons look amazing.

One thing I don't like about the game is that some upgrades need a lot of gems. In witch you do not get much of though out the game without buying them. I like that you can watch a ad to get some and all but, it only give one or two. When you need 130 to upgrade. I wish that you did not have to wait too long but I could understand that the game people need to make money. I just wish we had a chance to get more gems. 

I love the game and but I do not like that you need to buy some things."
US	4	2016-04-05	2.0.3	Bloomica15	I love this game but,	I love this game! The graphics are great, the gameplay is smooth (except for ads, but that has to happen😂) This game is really awesome, but it keeps refreshing randomly. Right when I'm in the middle of a battle it decided to refresh, and it wastes my energy. Also, some of the thug s are bit overpriced. The waiting time is also an issue. Maybe take all the waiting times down 2 hours? I hate waiting 8 hours for my new hatchling. 😂😂 other than these minor issues, the game is awesome! Thanks for reading! ~Moonstar
US	1	2016-04-04	2.0.3	Too low chances	Rip off	"I payed a bunch of money to get the tribal pack then it says ""error please try again"" while not giving me the stuff and charging me for it. This is complete crap and don't use any money on this game"

US	4	2016-04-02	2.0.3	Purse 649274749637492846	Janeucnss	It's a good game so far
US	4	2016-04-02	2.0.3	Bkeepme	Really	Seems to be a good game.  Considering that there are few that compare. Wish there were more ways to level up dragons without spending money. And less advertisements when you get on the game.
US	2	2016-04-02	2.0.3	Littlebit2342	Great game except for ads	Love the game but the excessive ads have me not playing it like I used to. Barely can play the actual game before getting an ad. Used to not have them or if there was ads it was very rare. Daughter plays the game also and the ads with the game distracts her or sends her out of the game completely.
US	5	2016-04-02	2.0.3	WolffeyAwesomeness	Awesome!	This game is egg - celent! Ha ha, I like it! Although I do wish you had more of a chance to win gems on the daily prize. Other than that, keep up the great work!

US	4	2016-04-02	2.0.3	How can we just have	Fun but everything cost way too much	The freemium game rears its ugly head sometimes where in which the game is designed in a matter that makes you have to spend real money to play certain aspects of it but the equivalent exchanged is not proportionate, also you have to invite people you know through Facebook. You should be able to add friends within the game as you can in clash of clans
US	4	2016-04-02	2.0.3	Lilmiss611	Dragon mania	First off would like a gift all button or at least to be able to click once to gift back to someone.   Takes too long to level up dragons when above level 20. I can't grow enough food.   Also would be great if some of the special dragon/events would more obtainable. But even with that I still love to play
US	5	2016-04-01	2.0.3	Linzgsxr	Best game on my phone!	I can spend hours playing this game! Love breeding the different dragons!
US	5	2016-04-01	2.0.3	Shay0125	WAS Awesome....	"Really fun game especially since the clans have been added. 
Really disappointing that I can't open the game since the last update a week ago. 
No response from game loft either. My recommendation......don't even get yourself started on it."
US	5	2016-04-01	2.0.3	--Paulsome--	Best game ever	Awesome graphics and the other things are also awesome!!!!!
US	5	2016-04-01	2.0.3	Hjffgjghfjhdjf	Awesome but slowwwww	This game is extremely fun to play. I love collecting the unique dragons and making homes for them, but it takes so long to do anything. It takes long to breed, grow, hatch, build, and it takes long for the meter to fill up to battle. Why is it like that?
US	5	2016-04-01	2.0.3	KAIROS THE GREAT!!!!!!!	OMG	OMG this game is so amazing
US	2	2016-04-01	2.0.3	Luiro	Aw, c'mon! Seriously?!?	"I do enjoy the game most of the time, but the glitches... Ugh.

For instance, more than once I've won a battle, yet out of nowhere, the game gives me two stars. It doesn't always gives you the promised prizes for battles (mainly scrolls) plus other random fails. 

Get it together, guys!"

US	4	2016-04-01	2.0.3	Dragon Types	Ads are so annoying	The ads are helping but interrupt training and battles so I think there should not be ads or just a few every 30 mins
US	3	2016-04-01	2.0.3	Liv._.yyy	Problem...	I love everything about the game it's amazing, no problems with lag unless it's MY internet, no problems at all!.... Until now.. So I got to level 19 like a month ago, and I got an energy dragon, and waited for it to hatch, and I go to place it, it says I obviously need to buy a habitat, but I can't buy it, it says I have a maximum 18/18 but I don't even have one energy habitat... There wasn't much more for me to do, so I've stop playing but I want to play again..

US	4	2016-03-30	2.0.3	Exkwizit1	Great game! Too many pop-up ads	The game is great!  I actually don't care if there are ads but the random pop-ups at random moments is annoying.  I almost considered not playing anymore.
US	3	2016-03-30	2.0.3	Master decoy	Fun game, stop with the ads	I enjoy the game very much, but the advertisements have gotten completely out of control. Interrupting game play every few minutes without warning, accidentally tapping the ad takes you out of the game, very frustrating.
US	1	2016-03-30	2.0.3	Happy😃😛🔥🙊	Ottos lottery	OK so I like this game but I don't lottery makes me despise playing!! Yves to be you watch a video and you get a gem, but no now you have to spin a wheel  and you NEVER get a gem anymore!!!ITS INFURIATING😡😡!!

US	1	2016-03-30	2.0.3	ScottieE---	Ad Mania	The games name should now be renamed to describe what you are in for - Ad Mania. You may get to play a little, but mostly you will just be subjected to pop up ads.
US	5	2016-03-30	2.0.3	J,Cooper	My new favorite	I have been playing clash of clans for three years and tried this game and it took me over LOL. Most games I've Try I don't like
US	5	2016-03-30	2.0.3	cooldued892	BEST GAME EVER	THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!! But it does need less more ads.
US	5	2016-03-30	2.0.3	Tenguinlord	Awesome	It's a pretty cool game
US	3	2016-03-30	2.0.3	CarlyBethT	So annoying (but so addicting)	"Pretty fun game; it's addicting because there's always something new to do (plus the battles make me nostalgic for my Pokemon days). 

Only 3 stars because it refreshes SO much. I could normally get over something like this, but it's like it waits for me to start a battle and then when I actually do, it decides to refresh, which gets rid of an energy every time. It sounds silly, but those take a long time to refresh! The worst part, is that I made the mistake of spending actual money on the diamonds so I could refill the previously mentioned stolen energy. No exaggeration when I say that it literally refreshed at the start of every single one of the battles, wasting my energy, my money, and I suppose my dignity too. 

Lastly, everything's pretty expensive in this app. No doubt, it's good business (you know, the more expensive things are, the longer it takes to get them, so it takes a while to advance, so it seems like the game is updating all the time, but really it's probably taking the same amount of time as any other game, blah blah blah); truly, it's on the brink of brilliance. Props to you, really, but if you feel like letting your fans catch a break every now and then, it probably wouldn't kill you. 

Don't get me wrong; overall, the game is pretty fun (I've been playing it regularly for an embarrassingly long amount of time), people just need to prepare themselves if they're *mildly* impatient like I am!"
US	2	2016-03-30	2.0.3	Mr. MoJo 305	Too much waiting	To make this review short ... it's a good game but the waiting time is way too long. I played for a week only to realize I reached a point to where I can only do 1 thing and then have to wait 24 hours for that task to be completed. Getting your dragons past level 10 is a mission. Not because of difficulty, but because of the waiting period the game gives you. And when battling against level 12 dragons, there's no way to beat them (and in turn progress) without waiting and waiting and waiting. No matter how fun a game is, it is NO fun if you can't actually play it.
US	5	2016-03-29	2.0.3	Kateeaton	Fun but has glitches.	I have enjoyed the game but have not been able to connect with my Facebook. It also will randomly turn off. Other than that the game is cute and graphics are good.
US	5	2016-03-29	2.0.3	xenite90	Awesome	This game is really fun and addicting. The dragons are soo cute and lots to do.
US	4	2016-03-29	2.0.3	Mr. Person 12346890	Pretty Good, but...	I really like this game, but I cannot seem to add friends from the Lighthouse! I will give that extra star if I get some help! Thanks!
US	5	2016-03-29	2.0.3	Five stars if it's good	Finest game ever	The game is amazing but it could have less ads other than that it's the best game ever 😆😆😆
US	2	2016-03-29	2.0.3	Horseman	Good game but infested with advertisements	Gameplay is pretty good. Lots of things to do, cool dragons to play with. Unfortunately, any of the significant in-app purchases are EXORBITANTLY expensive and your game play is CONSTANTLY interrupted with advertisements. Frequently these ads are 15 or 30 second videos that eat up your cellular data. Not cool.

US	1	2016-03-29	2.0.3	vario	Too Many Ads	I really enjoy this game but hate the current version because of advertisements. Every other moment is interrupted with ads. It's really bad. If it continues I'm going to have to let this game go.
US	4	2016-03-29	2.0.3	Shadow Mewtwo66787	Awesome, but...	Too many ads, otherwise it's a great game.

US	5	2016-03-29	2.0.3	Gainecad	Cool	Cool
US	1	2016-03-29	2.0.3	Water6373	The ads are killing me!	I understand having ads but there are sooo many. I think I get one literally every 3 minutes. At least make it to where they can't pop up in battles in the middle of me attacking or at all, I've wasted so many portal gems since I'll accidentally click an ad when I mean to click to fight & it'll exit me out of the game! Or make it so VIPs don't get ads. Also I should be able to exit out of a 35 second video. I can still get the screen where it asks if I want to quit the video & when I select yes it just makes me watch the whole thing anyways
US	5	2016-03-29	2.0.3	Sybel_79	Great game	Very enjoyable game. I like the various types of dragons one can make. It can be a bit of a grind to get a good team of dragons leveled. However there are many ways to do this. One of my favorite things is it consistently rewards you with gems so you really do not have to buy them if you don't want to.

I've played other games with in-game purchase opportunities but never one that shoves it in your face as much as this one. This walking purse is resigning that role.  Goodbye and good riddance!

The game re-started back to level 1. So far, Gameloft does not have a fix, but keeps stating they are aware of the problem. Several people are experiencing this issue and Gameloft has no answers. They introduce new platforms and crash the existing ones. Do better Gameloft
US	5	2016-03-20	2.0.1	Gaby20 0	Every one	This is the best game ever keep it up
US	3	2016-03-20	2.0.1	FnafGirl363	Issue	I love the game but one of my issues is every 12 hours many of my dragons end up with question marks on their face and the game makes me download stuff to fix it, my phone only has 5 gigabytes of data and I want to play a game where I don't have to download anything else but updates.
US	5	2016-03-20	2.0.1	Jdggjhdghdjdhyr	Griggs	It is awesome
US	3	2016-03-20	2.0.1	ScipiosWrath	Advertisements	Ok, the game could be fun, if Gameloft isn't shoving advertisements at you every few mins of playing.  I woke up and turned the game on and clicked the dragon habitat and it paused the game for a 15 second advertisement.  About every 2-3 mins of play you HAVE to watch a 15 sec advertisement.  Other than the ungodly amount of time you spend watching the SAME 15 second commercial, the game could be pretty fun!
US	5	2016-03-20	2.0.1	Sissvsty	BEST GAME EVER	I got this amazing game when I watched an add and I haven't ever wanted to delete it is so addictive.

US	5	2016-03-20	2.0.1	More fixing	Need to fix	I have the game and it's fun and all but whenever I try to play it loads for a very very very long time. How could I play if it won't let me play. They need to fix this. The game is very good to play but how could I play it if it loads way to long.
US	3	2016-03-20	2.0.1	Soccer Hols	Won't LOAD	This app is good and all but I can't get onto the app and it won't load. This app is a waste of your time and time is valuable.
US	2	2016-03-20	2.0.1	LordRaptor	Fun game, but buggy..	This is a fun game with a lot to do, but there are a ton of bugs in it. It's a good game when it works, but it doesn't work often. I may uninstall soon.
US	4	2016-03-20	2.0.1	DerpyGuy123	Good game	No really it is!

US	4	2016-03-20	2.0.1	Clayvonne	Great graphics	Great graphics and very addictive.
US	5	2016-03-20	2.0.1	Kshaksosnisnso	Awesome Game!	great game over all, but there is one thing I wish would change. you shouldn't have to wait almost 30 minutes to go to other battles. and speeding the timing of things up should take gold, not gems. gems should only be for buying dragons that are past your level. but overall one of the best most fun games I've played
US	4	2016-03-19	2.0.1	Shadow0137	Game Center Username - StarCake	"I really like this game, but it won't allow me to connect to Facebook. I've talked to customer service about it a couple times and none of there solutions worked. Hopefully the next version will fix this issue - so I'll give it 4 stars.

I can still add people through Game Center though!"

US	3	2016-03-19	2.0.1	Funstuff67	Fun Game But...	This game is a lot of fun but the advertisements are awful. Every 5 minutes or so a 20 sec add pops up. It's really frustrating.
US	5	2016-03-19	2.0.1	Brodyreyes	Me	Best game ever so addictive
US	3	2016-03-19	2.0.1	Colorbright	Some issues	First, I like that the game is simple and the dragons are cute and fun to collect. But you have to invest too much in leveling individual dragons, basically the battles are won or lost based on dragon level with no other strategy. The islands are oddly shaped such that the buildings won't fit right and changing building positions is a pain. The creators of this game also charge way too much for paid upgrades. And bugs don't get fixed, hiring dragons has been broken for several months now. Still a fun and cute game.
US	5	2016-03-19	2.0.1	see below message	game play	"i just wrote a review tried to post says name is taken.....by who else then me. anyways im new to the game yet now im kicked out every whenever a lot more saying signed in from another account hard to believe when it is only downloaded on my ipad.  game constant restarts here and there when im in a battle or using friend dragon and when i get back in i lost the battle energy or cant use friends daragon saying it was used and tired now. ads are popping up like crazy in the beginning ihad no ads  but then every few minutes same ad would play over and over and over. when i first started this game was fun even the big battle for  dragons wheni try to refresh using gems im still against players that are 3x my dragon level and using 5 gems constantly is useless so i am getting fustrated with the game.  hope something can be done to bring back interest. 

nickname :  nunya718"
US	1	2016-03-19	2.0.1	Lizardscruff	Game is too glitchy - fix it! It's been a long time!	"Awesome and addictive but fix the kinks guys... You shouldn't be able to double log on one device. And you should be able to choose permanently that you want to use the data on this friggin device or the cloud data. An option to choose between the two would be nice! And stop crashing when I become VIP status and I lose my progress after killing 3 levels using bolt energy and friends dragons. That's total BS!! Now it acts like I didn't beat the levels and my bolts are gone plus I can't use my friends dragon for like 2 freaking days.

Update: not playing this game anymore. I have to spend so much time progressing which is fine but when I play for 30 mins and then the game freezes and I lose that 30mins progress like every other day I get frustrated. Fix it. You are losing players everyday.

Update 2:
Fix your F$$@&!! Game.  Every time I try to battle  on the Viking map and call a friend's dragon in, after the battle is done, I lose connection to server and the battle progress is lost as well as anything I did 15 minutes prior to said battle. My wifi works just fine with all my other games..."
US	5	2016-03-18	2.0.1	Sorverus	I love all Dragons!	This game is the best Dragon game I ever played I love everything y'all did with this game the graphics are amazing the story is epic and the Dragons... THE DRAGONS ARE SOOOOO CUTE! thank you for making such a amazing awesome game!!!! (^_^)
US	3	2016-03-18	2.0.1	Jessie😍	Conect the servers	Its a fun game but it would be a lot better if the servers  were conected. The clan update would be great if i could actually be in a clan with my friends but i can because the servers are not conected. It needs to be fixed.
US	5	2016-03-18	2.0.1	Nightmare horse	Good game	You game is so good to play.  When they downloading this game they will have fun taking care of the dragon
US	3	2016-03-18	2.0.1	britneenikole	TOO MANY ADS	I mean seriously. I have other games that aren't as well advertised as this game (which shows they make plenty of money) and they don't have a quarter of the ads this game does. Why not just allow players to watch more ads for spins instead of forcing them to watch a 45 second ad every 1-10 minutes. They always pop up at the most inconvenient times too. Get it together. I can hardly stand playing it at this point. Fun game but too many stupid advertisements that make me want to buy nothing.
US	5	2016-03-18	2.0.1	Jpok004	Fun, addictive and easy to play	Dragon mania is an awesome game. I would love to see a different kind of dragon. I'm talking about a double or even triple head dragon. Back in the old days they had a cartoon about dungeons and dragons and in it they had this fierce dragon w three heads. It wasn't a pet you want to keep at home but it was really cool. Would love to see a dragon of this magnitude. The possibilities of combinations are endless. I would also like to be able to organize my dragons not by element but by the level of training (# of scrolls) or alphabetizing them. So much easier to find when you're searching for a particular dragon for battle. That's all. Good job. Keep up the good work!
US	3	2016-03-17	2.0.1	kayla2731	Finally added clans but...	the ads are much more frequent

US	5	2016-03-17	2.0.1	cpainer3	Nice!!	Really fun interactive game!
US	4	2016-03-17	2.0.1	joat6	Losing progress	Since the new update, I've notice that progress I make gets lost. For example, the new clan quest was to level up dragons. I had just hatched a Void dragon and leveled it up to 4. Came back to the game a couple hours later and the dragon was back at one. Also I seem to spend as much time clicking off ads as I do playing. Please get the bugs fixed.
US	3	2016-03-17	2.0.1	41Arete	Update problem	I have tried playing after the last update, and it has locked up 4 times already. Need to fix lockups
US	2	2016-03-17	2.0.1	++monster ripper++	The adds ruin it	Used to be a fun game, but the adds ruined it. Hard to play when you get interrupted every few minutes and have to watch a video.  Used to play all the time, but now its just annoying, so I've quit
US	5	2016-03-17	2.0.1	Lordshrek20	Awesome	This game is perfect for my kids

US	4	2016-03-17	2.0.1	girlwithcamera 	Dragons	Love this game, great play but not to fond of the cost. You should be able to play without spending money or at least advance in the game.
US	1	2016-03-16	2.0.1	Steve-O_0301	BEWARE & READ B4 SPENDING $$ w Gameloft	"MAKE SURE YOU 1st GO TO THEIR FORUMS @ THE GAMELOFT WEBSITE FOR THIS & OTHER GAMELOFT GAMES TO SEE ALL THE DISGRUNTLED PLAYERS B4 DECIDING TO SPEND ANY MONEY W GAMELOFT!! I'm not just a angry customer writing a negative review but 1 of thousands upon thousands of unhappy customers who have experienced Gameloft's unethical & deceitful practices towards customers of all their games that are constantly expressing these issues & our dissatisfaction in their forums.

In their forums so many players clearly state Gameloft deceives players, changes the gameplay & rules without any notification often making prior in-app purchases invalid and of no use costing players a lot of money.  Gameloft releases defective glitch ridden games, lie, make false promises, claims & misrepresentations, deceive customers & blatantly bombard customers w unclear/untruthful ads designed to trick, manipulate & lure people to spend money w them and they will never play another Gameloft game or spend any money with Gameloft again!  I have owned and played a few Gameloft games spending several hundred dollars & although I enjoyed these games at first they always led to anger, frustration & disappointment for me & my family! 

However once they get your money they almost never respond to complaints or provide any useful support or customer service.  And sadly its not if but when you will eventually experience a major glitch causing you to lose all your game progress and/or items purchased thru in-app purchases that cannot be resolved requiring you to start the game from the beginning.  There is either no or limited support that doesn't correct the problem and sadly there is no recourse to get your money back.  In most instances customers almost never get responses & help for their complaints but instead Gameloft ignores their customers or instead will accuse them of being a cheater.  Often they even go to the extent of wrongly banning paying customers for supposed cheating, benefiting from a unknown glitch or hacking but won't provide any evidence or proof of this, refuse to accept & review information from a player to prove that they never cheated or did anything wrong so they can continue to play the game they paid a lot of money to play!

I feel it's important to warn potential customers so they don't go thru the frustration, anger and disappointment that goes with Gameloft games.  I think people should see the truth.  Visit their forums for other games like Ice Age Village, Ice Age Adventures and other games that have been around longer to see what players say about Gameloft and make your own decisions!  At least you will have the facts!!!"
US	5	2016-03-16	2.0.1	SAD rod	Beauty everywhere!!!	Wonderful game. Great EASY gameplay. Beautiful landscapes. Majestic dragons. Plus fun little mini games. Just AWSOME!!!
US	1	2016-03-16	2.0.1	Playpro5	Too many ads!	I understand that they are trying to make money but when an advertisement stops you from gameplay, that's out of hand. When I pet my dragons I accidentally click on a ad and it opens the browser and App Store every 10 mins or a ad video
US	5	2016-03-16	2.0.1	Fidutgfsgrsg	Cool game 👻	I love dragon mania legends because I try to collect every dragon possible and then battle

US	3	2016-03-16	2.0.1	jim77777	Cute but.......	This game is fun overall. But there are WAY TOO MANY ads. They pop up too often and lead you away from the game if your not careful. I'll keep playing for now but may drop the game if it continues.

US	2	2016-03-16	2.0.1	nfkapckns	Pretty good	I just got the game yesterday and I loved it, but when I tried to log in this morning, it said I needed an update. I tried to update but I didn't have enough space. I deleted about 3/4 of my apps and pictures, but it still didn't download. Finally I just cancelled it. I logged in, had my fun, then got out of the app. I then went back into the app and it said I don't have enough space. Somehow it ate up all my storage and even though I deleted it, I still don't have a lot of storage. I'm really disappointed.
US	4	2016-03-15	1.9.2	Kidmld	Nice game	So far, so good. The game is nicely polished and the graphics are smooth. But the ads pop out on you like nobody's business. Otherwise, it's a good play.
US	5	2016-03-15	1.9.2	Mostafa;)	I love it but...	I love this game and i have so much fun when playing but there is a problem without wifi,i cant load the game with cellular network plz fix this thanks ❤️
US	5	2016-03-15	1.9.2	Werewolf71	DragonML	Love the game it's cool
US	4	2016-03-15	1.9.2	K the reviewer	Love the game, hate the Ads	The game is great. My whole family enjoys playing it but there are so many Ads! I can't even play for a minute these days without an ad popping up. Even my little one has commented on all the increased ads to the game. There is no feature to pay for ad free play either which makes it even more frustrating. We love this game but I find we don't play it as much now because we all dread the ads. Please fix this problem.
US	3	2016-03-14	1.9.2	All nicknames are taken faq	Fun game but....	The ads are so annoying and it irks me that I lose some of my progress every time i close the game and thus have to start again this game needs better saving because it only saves half my progress so therefore it only gets 3 stars if you fix these issues i will put it to five stars
US	3	2016-03-14	1.9.2	Jap1990Lo($)	Fun game but...	Please can we quit with the constant trailer pop ups you have to watch half of before being allowed to exit?! They are getting worse-I understand ads in a free game but the frequency is now just annoying on a new level
US	5	2016-03-14	1.9.2	Kmu1983	Amazing	Awesome game
US	4	2016-03-14	1.9.2	FireyGracidea	Best Dragon Breeding Game, But Too Glitchy	Fun game. Easy to understand interface. Pay to win af game. But can something be done about the glitch where all the dragons are grey with question marks instead of well, their respective dragon. It's been like this for two weeks for me, and it's very frustrating. Also, I can't accept gifts from friends for some reason; the gifts will be marked as new, but they won't load. This game has become too glitchy to enjoy anymore.
US	2	2016-03-14	1.9.2	Bigcatcass	Ads😡😡	There are ads every 30 seconds. I have lost account when I'm battling and ads Interrupt me during dragon fury or about to hit or defeat a dragon. On the arena battles, I had a 9 streak win and battling a hard. I was about to defeat and ad pops up during dragon fury, I exit out the ad and it kicks me out. When I log back in I lose ALL of my battling progress. Will change to 5 star if you take out most of the ads and a little side note. It would be awesome if the boss dragons you buy. You can do to them what you can do to every other dragon, and also take them to battle
US	3	2016-03-13	1.9.2	BadA**87p	Game	Cool
US	5	2016-03-12	1.9.2	Scory p	Dragon game!	This game is awesome. Interaction is pretty good. Can tickle him forever. Good job.
US	4	2016-03-12	1.9.2	Jules'	Lovely	It's a lovely game and pretty addictive but my one main dislike of this game is that the dragons need a better designs but otherwise it's a nice game to play
US	5	2016-03-12	1.9.2	Average 6th Grader	I LOVE IT! But...	I am at level 22, and the game will not allow me to unlock my love dragon's second element, which apparently needs me to be at level 20. I figured that this is probably a glitch. Another thing that annoys me is that the same Nissan ad pops up in my face and doesn't allow me to close it until 5 seconds after the ad has ended. I'm not demanding you to remove ads, I just wish they wouldn't pop up like that. Maybe they could be on the top/bottom??
US	5	2016-03-11	1.9.2	Reliablecondom	I like it	Good game addictive and many dragons👍
US	5	2016-03-11	1.9.2	Minieller	Sweetest game I've ever had but...	This game is the most amazing game I've ever had and still have I would defiantly recommend it. All the different type of dragon, the fighting, the friend, the breeding, and the leveling up its just the funniest game I've played but there's just one thing...lol there nothing wrong with it 😂😂😂😂❤️
US	5	2016-03-10	1.9.2	Mother Vovo	Cool	Fun game great graphics and easy to play very very addictive
US	5	2016-03-09	1.9.2	Tennis man035	Really really love this game!	This game is everything I want in a dragon game. Fighting, adventure, and breeding. I suggest this game to many people.
US	5	2016-03-09	1.9.2	Ikillcats	Awesome, but....	A good game but, please lower the feeding prices they are wayyyyyy to much!
US	5	2016-03-09	1.9.2	Queen Missy	Great!	This game is wonderful, keeps a bored teenager like me occupied and entertained!
US	4	2016-03-09	1.9.2	RadioTez	Yup!!!!	"Super fun family game. Learn to share!
Connectivity issues sometimes."
US	4	2016-03-09	1.9.2	FitCuppyCake	Can't put my phone down	Fun and easy to learn, beautiful design, cute dragons, and many things to do while playing. I would have rated it 5 stars if not for the continuous advertisements and pop-ups.
US	2	2016-03-09	1.9.2	Mavira Dawnstrider	DragoML	Awesome game. Neat mechanics. Lousy network/servers. I get disconnected a lot across various wifi networks even at full strength. Wouldn't be so bad but the game doesn't refund your energy or gold for not finishing something due to disconnect.... Also, way too many commercials that interrupt play. And if you happen to be tapping away? It'll load the webpage/app screen for the sponsored commercial.
US	4	2016-03-08	1.9.2	ThePotatoFromGravityFalls	Awesome Sauce!!!!	This is the best dragon game ever!!!!!! I love the animation and that there are TONS of different kinds of dragons! But On the downside... Some items cost a lot of gems. Other than that I LOVE this game!!:-)  it would also be nice if u could have a feature where the dragons can fly... Or at least the ones with wings...😶
US	5	2016-03-08	1.9.2	Steelcudajr	Why u people hating?	I love this game! There are no bugs for me but I wish anyone having bugs good luck . TIP restart your iPad if not loading
US	3	2016-03-07	1.9.2	Best around.	Best Game Ever! But one minor flaw...	This is the beat game ever! I can repeat that for days. Then, after I got through the tutorial, I got dumped with ads! So that's why I rate it 3* instead of 5*
US	2	2016-03-07	1.9.2	7H0R5P90	The constant ads are making me hate the game.	Love this game, but the constant pop up (full screen/can't skip or exit them) ads are making me hate the game. They pop up when I'm trying to collect things or move across my islands and it causes me to click the ad which makes the game freeze and makes me dislike it.
US	3	2016-03-07	1.9.2	Girlygirlgamer4442	Meh	This game it fun when you first get it but it gets really boring after u get to like leave 15 or more.  I don't like it very much but that's just my opinion.
US	1	2016-03-06	1.9.2	Daryk groves	Awesome game BUT.!!	What's with these ads that pop up !! Seriously fix this issue its pissing me and many thousand people playing.!
US	4	2016-03-06	1.9.2	Silent Twinkie	A review	A decent game. Seems pretty good, looks like it could turn into a money grab, but we'll see.
US	3	2016-03-06	1.9.2	mdkellyak	fun but expensive	its a between monsters and dragon city but more expensive right off the bat. i do love the graphics tho
US	1	2016-03-06	1.9.2	So gayyyyyy	Adds adds and adds	Stupid adds. Stupid owner of the game.
US	4	2016-03-06	1.9.2	Bryana2005	Sound.	There's a sound glitch that makes the game have no sound. Its a good game though.
US	5	2016-03-06	1.9.2	SuperCorn786swag	This is a 5 ⭐️ game 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀	The graphics are amazing. The storyline is great. There's nothing bad about it. This game is awesome.😃😃😃😃😃😃
US	3	2016-03-05	1.9.2	Adssuck123455	Ads	You need to either fix the AT&T ad or remove it it freezes the entire game and makes you restart it multiple times it makes you not want to play any longer!!!!!

US	3	2016-03-05	1.9.2	Dino judge	Stupid ads	The game is great but stupid ads come up and cover half the screen an forces me to back out

US	5	2016-03-05	1.9.2	Jovdg	awesome	love the dragons
US	1	2016-03-05	1.9.2	GhandalfThePissed	OMG ADS!!!!	Like the game, but lately ads have been rudely popping up and harshing my buzz. Unless you are the kind of person who watches tv only for the commercials, don't bother downloading the game. You will wind up so mad that you will likely punch a baby.
US	5	2016-03-05	1.9.2	Magicmailman	awsome	I love this game I've always liked dragons and this games is perfect
US	2	2016-03-05	1.9.2	Lovedragons1357	Amazing game--Terrible ads!!	I would give this game 5-stars except after the most recent update the ads are unbearable. The pop up every 20-30 seconds, during battles, or while claiming prizes, causing me to lose several resources. PLEASE REMOVE THESE ADS!! I have no problem with ads but many of these (like the AT&T ones) I can't close and need to force quit the whole game. Please fix this and I will gladly rereview for 5-stars.
US	5	2016-03-05	1.9.2	Kate😊❤️	Awesome game, but there are some problems!	I love the graphics of this game. The dragons are awesome and super adorable. The two problems I have are the ads and the gems. I understand that app companies need to make money, but the ads are very annoying and to speed up a 4 hour breeding time for 45 gems is ridiculous!! The ads pop up all of the time during the time I'm playing. Otherwise the game is perfect and I highly recommend it!! 😄
US	2	2016-03-05	1.9.2	utsiiiiiiii	Too many ads :(	I LOVE this game. I've been playing for 6+ months now. The game itself is a 5/5 easily. However recently the pop-up advertisements have gotten out of control. Sometimes they don't even have exit buttons so I have to completely quit the app and re-start it. The ads also pop up during the middle of battles, causing me to lose. I understand having ads, but ones that you can't even leave without shutting the whole game down is just ridiculous.
US	3	2016-03-05	1.9.2	KiruwaZ	Great game until the latest set of ads...	I really loved playing this game but the introduction of the latest set of AT&T ads has broken the game severely. The ads interrupt fights and anything else you can touch on the screen and if you were on an iPhone there is no option to close the ad.  You have to force quit the game and restart. This has caused the loss of several resources and battles which in the dungeon is a significant setback. Because of this I have stopped playing the game except to collect food, gold and breed dragons.  I no longer go into fights or dungeons. Because of this game is losing its appeal and I hope they will fix it soon.
US	5	2016-03-05	1.9.2	Taylorsmom5	Great Game	This is my favorite game. That graphics are excellent. Better then other dragon games that I've been on. Lately o have had issues with some of the ads not letting me exit out of them. I have to completely log out and log in. It's the AT&T that is the issue. Outside of all the crazy ads that continually pop up I love this game
US	3	2016-03-04	1.9.2	Paigeeeeeeeeeee1994	Love it but...	There are WAY too many adds now. I have an iPhone and I just tried to play but I couldn't because the add that showed up WOULDNT GO AWAY!
US	1	2016-03-04	1.9.2	Hello in there	Was Banned Wrongfully	"I start the game, don't play it much, then when I get on it bans me for 2 weeks saying I had ""suspicious activity"", I have not cheated the game and I can't even make a support ticket because it didn't tell me my Ticket ID thing. 1/10 was fun for the day I played it."
US	1	2016-03-04	1.9.2	BoogiesBear	Dragon Mania Legends	"Ok I love this game! First off I want to say that because I only gave it one star. The game itself is the best mobile game I've seen in years, probably since angry birds first came out! Now the reason for the one star... Here recently ads have been rudely interrupting my gameplay every two mins the whole darn time I'm trying to play... Seriously no exaggeration every two mins I'm forced to view the same 3 Wendy's or Twitter ads which makes me never want to long in to Twitter or eat at Wendy's ever ever again!!! I would gladly pay for a ad free version of the game but as far as I know that's not a option. Lastly Gameloft's customer service is just horrible! What customer service lol they can't even be reached so oh gosh forbid you have a issue with a in game purchase! I will gladly give a 5 star review when changes are made in these areas because the game is awesome... When the 
ads allow you to play!"
US	4	2016-03-04	1.9.2	TheMaddersing	Oh My God, These Ads	This is such a cool game, and it has incredible potential, but sweet baby Jesus, these ads. They are so freaking annoying, and they pop up at LEAST every two minutes. I tap on something, and BAM. A thirty-second video swoops in to ruin the day. I get frustrated to the point where I close the app, and I don't open it for the rest of the day. Listen, dear people that are responsible for the game, nobody is going to want to play this game if you're assaulting people with these ads. Please, PLEASE fix this.
US	4	2016-03-04	1.9.2	BroJoe088	Love this game but TooManyAdds	A few adds here and there I don't mind but when I get one every like two mins that's when I draw the line. What makes me really mad is that whenever I'm about to click on something in the game Boom an add pops up and I end up clicking on the add instead and then this thing about AT&T pops up and it says shop now and there's no way to exit out of it and so I have to exit the whole game and boot it back up again and I have to do this a lot with how many adds pop up :(
US	4	2016-03-03	1.9.2	Emeraldgirl53	Framer Rose	Love the game!

US	3	2016-03-02	1.9.2	sophia72198	Frustrated	This is fun game, but I spend more time watching ads then playing the game, and they're way more persistent about getting you to buy stuff now. It's annoying!

US	2	2016-02-27	1.9.2	Butterscotch98765	TOO MANY ADS!	I have never written a review before, but am compelled to do so now because of this game's excessive and intrusive ads. Otherwise it's an OK game, but I won't be playing it.
US	4	2016-02-27	1.9.2	CAJLINER	Coooooool!	Not bad. Challenging. Can't wait to get to higher levels. Spent 50 jewels and didn't get my snow dragon egg. Can't figure out where it went. Play on.

US	3	2016-02-27	1.9.2	A l k 1 3	Like it but they are kind of copying	So far I am really liking this game! I like how there are different dragons. But there is 1 problem, I feel like they are sort of copying Dragon City.
US	4	2016-02-27	1.9.2	LLAMAS💗💗	Love it! But some problems...	I absolutely love this game! It's very entertaining and the quality is beautiful. However, I've become very annoyed about food and gems. I understand that want gems to be difficult to obtain, but things that cost gems cost wayyyyyy too much, and they're very hard to get. I REALLY need to upgrade my hatchery, but it costs so many gems and it takes too long to obtain gems, and there is NO way that I'm spending real money on gems. It's really annoying. Secondly, food. Food has the same issue. How come a dragon can ONLY level up by eating meanwhile it's won so many battles!? And how come it costs so much food to feed a dragon. I can feed like, my level 20 one thing and I'm out of food. Annoying and unnecessary!!! It would be nice if you made it that dragons don't have to eat as much food,easier to get food, and also let dragons level up by battles.
US	5	2016-02-26	1.9.2	RyhahaRy	超好玩	真的(｡･ω･｡)好消磨时间的好游戏
US	5	2016-02-26	1.9.2	-jai2005-	Pretty darn awesome but please read	I like it and to me it feels like an accomplishment when I get epics or legends but when the wifi goes out... You lose all the progress. For instance say your building a void habitat and the wifi goes out. The only thing you lose is money and the void habitat is nowhere to be seen. Anyways it is a awesome game.
US	5	2016-02-25	1.9.2	Justin Chisolm	Superb game, but...	"Love the game and all, and understand the how these types of games work, but there is problem. The Ad videos are quite intrusive at times, interrupting game play and sometimes causing the lose of coins and activities that are in mid-play. Yes, I know these ads are vital and and necessary but do they really have to be placed in such a way they disrupt the game??? I've experienced no less 5 advertisements in the 20min of game play today. Yes it was the same ad over and again. Honestly, I hate them, but I know it is apart the beast. I'm hoping there's a way to better set these ads up, so at the very least they don't ruin game play. 
Thanks"
US	3	2016-02-24	1.9.2	KelsoWin	3 star adds	There are adds exactly 5 minutes apart. If there weren't adds every five minutes of game play this app would be a five. The adds used to only pop up if you wanted free gems.  Now it doesn't matter if you clicked on free gems or not. You are stuck with adds every five minutes!
US	5	2016-02-24	1.9.2	Cristiannn_o	Dragon maen	New
US	4	2016-02-24	1.9.2	Tcmma2013	DRAGONS!	It's fun. Interactive. Takes too long for gems and money to go on sale. I like the new islands. I think that Kronos should set time back 12 hours and reset the money you can collect from your habitats. But really fun.
US	5	2016-02-22	1.9.2	Akura🌸	Love the dragons	I was disappointed that I didn't get sunrise dragon, but that's okay at least I have a whole bunch of other dragons..it's like you add on on each dragons...that a cool way to do dragons and other ideas.......I have a lot of ideas in mind....but can't..love the app and fave dragon is crystal😛 besides its easier to obtain gems....
US	1	2016-02-22	1.9.2	CadenceMatah	Snails are faster	This game is crap. Progression through the game is slower than a snail. I blaze through dragon city faster than this. You're loosing my interest in this game Gameloft. It needs farm improvements to put more food out in less time and for less gold. The battle arenas on the battle map are horrible. I can't get three stars anymore, so I can't earn anymore scrolls to improve my dragons and it takes so much food to level them up that I can't do anything. I've been stuck in the same stupid place for several months now. This game doesn't even deserve one star. Horrible game.
US	5	2016-02-21	1.9.2	Madasheck321463747	Love The Dragons 💙	The game itself is very fun, I think the only thing I can find wrong with it is that they didn't put a lot of effort into making the dragons they messed up what ever they could with a dragon and called it good. But that's the only thing I can find wrong with the game it's fun I like the features you can do with your dragons and the graphics very nice.
US	4	2016-02-21	1.9.2	meg2LD	My kids and I love this game!	My son got me started playing this game, and we have really enjoyed sharing tips about fighting, talking about which dragons we're  breeding, etc. It's a very fun game, and great for all ages. There are a few bugs that I am looking forward to being worked out, with error messages when signing on, and the game quitting during fights. I also had a problem where we repeatedly tried to buy gem packs, and saw an error message, where the gems were never received, but it turns out I was being billed. I'm hoping to work that out soon.
US	5	2016-02-21	1.9.2	Wumbo719	Great except for a few things...	This game is great, but there are a few problems: the training is a bit unfair. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but when I wait for the right time to hit the Viking doll in aiming at, another doll gets in the way and makes me hit it instead of my target, and then I get behind and I miss the other Vikings I'm supposed to hit. Also, I can't find a the place on the lighthouse where I can enter recruitment codes. Otherwise, keep up the good work!
US	5	2016-02-20	1.9.2	Osos mom	Addictive	Love it.  Too much.  Very addictive and the dragons are too dang cute.
US	5	2016-02-20	1.9.2	Water melon watch me wip	Awesome game	This is such a great game but why does stuff cost money ugh and can we get like 10 free gems every time we level up
US	5	2016-02-19	1.9.2	Goods798	AWESOME game	"It's a fun game to play its nothing like dragon vale because you get to fight dragons it's AWESOME but needs wifi
YOU SHOULD GET IT"
US	5	2016-02-17	1.9.2	Gidgetflatn	Great game so cute!	Love short term goals and all the options. Dragons are so neat. So many different kinds of dragons w all their elements and abilities. My preschoolers love the game too! Family friendly game for all ages! Does have some busy server issues on weekends sometimes but it's understandable bc it's most likely a popular game! Love the updates and the new games like the frost festival. This games is one of the best of its kind!!!
US	4	2016-02-11	1.9.2	aramina48	Crashing issue	Since the last update (or maybe the one before it) the game has been crashing a LOT on the main screen. Doesn't seem to have a problem on the arena or adventure/battle screens. Also, please make it possible to have regular battles without Internet. It's so frustrating to be midway through an important one when your wifi drops out. I can understand why arena battles would need wifi, but the regular ones?
US	3	2016-02-11	1.9.2	DavidF25	Greedy developers	I realize you don't have to spend any money on it but the prices in the game aren't even reasonable by the games own standards which leads me to believe the developers have lost their minds and we should probably send help
US	5	2016-02-10	1.9.2	skingxD	good	good
US	5	2016-02-10	1.9.2	V-tine08	Amazing	Game is amazing. I love it and can't stop playing. Truly a great game
US	4	2016-02-10	1.9.2	Hypnogourd	Fun dragon management	"This game is lots of fun. Games within games keep my interest. I know the developers need the money to keep making more games and updates but I tend to make the small purchases and just work slowly through the levels. The higher the level the longer it takes to upgrade the habitats or level up the dragons. I am not one to rush through a game so that works for me. If you are a serious gamer, you may be want to invest to move up faster. Overall, I am happy with all the facets of managing my dragons and the cute little developer news feeds that come out every once in a while.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because some items cannot be had without purchasing them. That is the only real flaw but I enjoy playing it anyway so just accept I will not be able to have every single dragon."
US	4	2016-02-09	1.9.2	Derfnose	Decent game with Facebook bug	"Fun little game with quite insane real money prices. Decent content with little waiting for free. My main issues thus far is the bug keeping me from actually connecting to Facebook to invite a few close friends. For 2 months now the game will do nothing but ""collecting free dragon"" when trying to connect to Facebook."
US	5	2016-02-06	1.9.2	HChristin3	Dragon Mania Legends	I gave this game five stars because it's great! The art is wonderful and the sounds aren't annoying. There is nothing you can't do; you don't have to buy the special currency to finish and of the quests. Saying that, the gems are relatively easy to come by. There's plenty to do also! It also updates often.
US	4	2016-02-06	1.9.2	"Let's just call me"" Genius"""	Love this game- but serious problem!	"Great game. I love every part, from the dragons to the fights to the events... Except for when the Wifi is low. 2 minutes before I wrote this review, I lost my last fighting energy bolt. You get 3. I had done this fight several times, but I was stopped halfway throughout all of them , and when the Wifi goes out, I lose all progress except the money I spent or lost on some transaction that was half finished when the signal goes out. I was watching my blow streak towards a Salamander dragon, the blow that would knock it out and let me win. I watched it hit- and yet again the Internet clocked off again. It had done this before, once on a couple hits before winning, when one dragon was left, but still... 1 second before winning, and about 5 before I would get the message that I had won. I cursed at the screen. It wasn't like I could try again, not for a half- hour at least.
All this said, this is a great game that I have on many devices but... The Wifi!!😡😡"
US	5	2016-02-05	1.9.2	Radio baby	Update	The new update made everything sooooo much better!!!
US	4	2016-02-05	1.9.2	Wendy123wizardarod	Leveling up my dragons	I love the game so far, but think that it could be better if there were more ways to level up my dragons other than just feeding them.
US	4	2016-02-05	1.9.2	Nathon21	I wish I was able to move dragons into another habitat	I love the game! So much fun and great quests to do. However, I do wish I was able to move my dragons into different habitats. I would like to be able and organize my dragons in the habitat I see fit but I'm unable to do. Hopefully in a future update I'll be able to do so. :( Upside, with new update I can now change my dragons name :)
US	4	2016-02-05	1.9.2	Robius One	Artful, well designed game if you have patience	Let's look at this game for what it is... An artful slog designed to get you to pay real money at some point. In that sense this game is a fantastic well honed exercise. My kids love the dragon art and I have to say this is not thrown together - it's a great looking game throughout with beautiful touches and flourishes here and there. When you finally lose patience and hand over the money (probably $9.99), the payoff is not significant and doesn't really help gameplay... But everyone has to eat so help these developers out for designing at least pretty things for us to look at. Beyond that, the dragon breeding is fun and the math behind it seems solid. Fun times if you are into genetics and that sort of thing. A great time waster and a solid excuse to not move forward with more positive goals in your life.
US	4	2016-01-27	1.8.1	Animal artist	Great game, minor cons	"Overall this was a fantastic game, good combat, cool dragons(I really like the dragons, very cool designs) However there are a couple things that could be fixed:
•at level 17 I found it hard to cultivate enough food to level up my dragons without going broke. We still need money to buy habitats, level them up, and buy new dragons when it's time (Plant, water, metal, etc. must be bought not bred). Sometimes I spend an hour growing food only to feed one dragon once. I try to battle to earn the money or explore, but ironically enough my dragons need to be a certain level to do it which can't be achieved because I don't have the food.
•1.5/4 times I will have a timer that is say, an hour. I will time it with something else, come back an hour later, and the timer is still set on 1 hour.
Overall I would definitely recommend this game!"
US	5	2016-01-27	1.8.1	:-);-):4	Best dragon farm app	I love this because you can interact with your dragons by petting them and getting coins, train them, and feed them (by tossing food to their mouth, so cute). You can battle up to 3 dragons at a time. I also love the graphics. It's not as cartoony as most others, but it's still cartoony & 3D. I would prefer it any other way.
US	3	2016-01-25	1.8.1	beeawkward	Amazing game, but the ads...	"I love the game, and I spend a lot of time on it, but...
The ads are wayyy to frequent, and they are ALL disgusting smoking ads. Why on earth would I want to see a brain melting away every five seconds?  This game is designed for kids, not to annoy people and give children nightmares."

US	5	2016-01-23	1.8.1	IZOFTX	Cutest dragons ever😍	This game is so much fun even though I just bought it
US	5	2016-01-23	1.8.1	Fyrefel	THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC!!!	I absolutely love Dragon Mania Legends. This is the second time I've owned this game, and it has gotten even better than before, which I didn't know was possible. It is never repetitive, and even though there are wait times they aren't frustrating at all. There are so many dragon types, and breeding them to try and get a rare, epic, or legendary isn't so elusive that it makes things depressing....you definitely have to try a few times but it isn't impossible. I love the battles, the elemental types (especially the new light and shadow) and how you get to form an ideal fighting team. There are events and goals and so many different things to participate in. I cannot stress enough about how much you need to get this game. IT IS AWESOME SERIOUSLY GET IT
US	5	2016-01-23	1.8.1	Whyareallthenicknames.taken	A+	Fantastic gameplay, fun graphics. It's my favorite phone app and I'm totally addicted.

US	5	2016-01-22	1.8.1	AJL Grandmama	Fun and well balanced game	Good level of difficulty, interesting contests, not greedy one can advance without spending a lot of $$, nice graphics
US	2	2016-01-22	1.8.1	KellySA	Unbearable ads	My little brother and I used to love this game, until it became covered in the kind of pop ups that come unexpectedly, cover the entire screen, and are difficult to close. Many times I have clicked one accidentally and been navigated out of the app. Too frustrating to continue playing. By all means incorporate ads and get your pay, but don't betray the user.
US	5	2016-01-21	1.8.1	Trainz12345	❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Okay I love this game I'm not having any bugs or errors or anything as I usually don't get the graphics are great the dragons all are adorable and cute and the games are fun it's a good game if you willing to use up a bunch of your time and get sorta addicted like I did but it does have 1 or 2 flaws I think they could be a little more creative I mean really the banana dragon? But it's still really fun!!!! Also if your looking through reviews trying to find referral codes for prizes through the friendship totem here's mine: 56a01f
US	5	2016-01-19	1.8.1	dungmonkey 	Pretty amazing so far	"I play this mostly on my Apple TV, and for the most part it is amazing, however, it could use some fine tuning.  For this reason, I use my iPad to check in on the dragons and collect coins, as the touch screen makes this process much easier.  

As far as upgrades-

I would like the ability to trade dragons with others, and I wish it was easier to make friends.

And why not have some clans/alliances?  Then we could battle other teams, or battle the computer together. 

And on mobile- the full page video ads are beyond tiresome.  There should be a way to eliminate them permanently once a certain amount has been spent.  (Say $5)

Overall- great job, and keep improving it please! And add more dragons!!"
US	5	2016-01-11	1.8.1	Abidoodles.irvin	Great	Most of the games I played in the past similar to this one had a very low budget feel and sadly later abandoned by the company, however this game is very well rendered allowing you to interact with each creature individually. It allows many different game play options such as social combat, of combat, building, breeding, training, and etc... There is always new content thus far and has been wonderful.
US	4	2016-01-10	1.8.1	Wolfgirl12935	Wow	I really like this game the only thing they should change is how many diamond to speed up things also for the trees and rocks they cost to much to get rid of them

US	5	2016-01-08	1.8.1	🐾Jai🐾	❤️Favorite Game!❤️	This is by far one of my favorite games, it not only teaches me patience, which everyone needs, but it also teaches me a thing or two about money conservation. It pushes you to collect gold, farm, level up, train and battle! It's an amazing game, the best dragon game I've seen as of late.

US	5	2016-01-08	1.8.1	Mirageleader	Great game	I love mythical creatures and this game has one of my favorites. Still it could be improved on like for one making it easier to collect gems or make food faster and easier. Clash of clans is something to look at because its easy fun and you can get gems for removing stuff. Add that idea and it would be better. All in all though its great
US	4	2016-01-07	1.8.1	lovebear12	Just Starting	I've played a few dragon based games in the past so I thought I would give this one a try.  I like that that you interact with the dragons more in this game than you ever could in others, but as I have only been playing for three days I felt four stars was a good rating to provide.
US	4	2016-01-07	1.8.1	Mr. Beettle	Recruitment code 91c54!!!	Anazing graphics, fun gameplay, and cool dragons! This game is amazing! Im proud to boast having a level 12 elemental, level 11 tribal, level eleven bee, level 10 agent, and level 10 regal. Im also proud to boast a level 8 cyborg, a level 4 armored, and an unhatched lynx dragon! My only complaint is the button to type in recruitment codes disappeared. Is this so you have to use Facebook or a weird bug? Please fix or put in the help questions. Thanks for all of your hard work, DML team!

US	2	2016-01-03	1.8.1	vivianxlee	>:(	Ok so this game is fun, BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE SO MANY POP UP ADS AND RELOAD THE GAME. Once I was just about to beat a really hard dragon and I was in the middle of a dragon fury but then you HAD to reload the game and then when it loaded again I lost my energy AND I had to try beating the dragons again. And now I can't get past that level. Thanks a lot. -_-

US	5	2016-01-03	1.8.1	Donlaven	Fun	"This was a great game. And one I played regularly. I don't play so much anymore because of the money spent on this game, then to lose my levels. I was up to level 72 and had a ton of dragons. Then my grandson hit a button or 2 on my work iPhone and wham, I was back at the beginning. This was actually caused by Apple's Game Center. I sometimes play one of these type games without spending any money just to see how long it takes to achieve same levels.
It is fun game, just don't spend much money. It's not worth it."

US	4	2015-12-31	0	With Issues	Good & Fun	The game is fun, just how can you edit your islands it would be better. I played it for awhile, but until I needed to edit I couldn't find out how. then I realized there was no way to edit, so now I have to clear and buy more islands instead. In conclusion, I think you should add island editing well everything but the trees, rocks, and the flowers of course!

Some people say it's a copy of dragonvale, but trust me, this game is Da Bomb! I would like if you added more realistic and cooler dragons and maybe make a new element or two. Here are a couple dragons I made:
Psychic dragon (void, wind, energy.)
Quad dragon (plant, metal, energy, void.)
Atom dragon (legendary.)
I hope you add these and more awesome dragons!"

The dragons are cute and friendly and it's not as expensive as other games,but I really hate the advertisements. Why? Because every time I upload the game an advertisement for a stop smoking thing comes up and shows a spider like creature and It scares the crap out of me plus I hate spiders. Please get rid the advertisement because I don't want to see that spider like creature ever again.

And now, random ads?"

US	2	2015-12-28	1.8.1	Thisbeanapprovednickname	TOO MANY ADS!	This game rocks, or at least it would IF I COULD PLAY IT. The pop up ads TAKE UP THE WHOLE SCREEN AND ARE FAR TOO EASY TO ACCIDENTALLY HIT. They also appear EXCESSIVELY OFTEN in a negative connotation. FIX THIS PROBLEM.

US	5	2015-12-27	1.8.1	aruiz11065	This Game Is Awesome!!	I love this game but there's this one thing I've always been wanting, it's trading. Can you please put trading dragons in your game the next update I'd really appreciate it!
US	2	2015-12-27	1.8.1	Drijien	Money Grab 101	If you are designing an app just to fleece people of cash, this is the app for you. Annoying pop-up adds galore. In app games designed to only allow progression if you pay.  An otherwise good game destroyed by another horrible update. Doubling the cost of every item and action in the game then making combat horrible is not a good way to further a franchise. Unless you want to spend a fortune in real money expect to take ridiculous amounts of time to further yourself in the game. The game designer would have been better off just making it a pay-for app instead of resorting to deceit.

US	4	2015-12-23	0	Soulivium	Good Solid Game, Few Key Issues	"I've played this game for a while now, and I think this is a good game so far. That being said, there are some improvements that I think would help a lot.

Pros:
- Plenty of things to do to keep a player well occupied.
- Good graphics and art style.
- Free to play.

Cons:
- Those pop-up ads that cover the whole screen are annoying when I'm trying to collect food/gold. I often tap on the ads by accident. I get that you guys use ads to generate extra revenue, but can't we have something like having more video ads for gems (the hot air balloon) so we have a choice to tap on the ad?
- Can I PLEASE change all my dragons' names? It kills me when my dragons are randomly named and I can't change them. I would LOVE to personalize my dragons by naming them my way.
- As of Dec 2015, the type matchup chart (fire > water, etc.) for PvE is very confusing. The old ""arrows pointing to the weaker element"" format would've been clearer. Could something be done for the matchups easier and more intuitive?
- Cross-platform interaction is lacking. I, an iPhone user, cannot seem to friend a Samsung user. Would be nice to be able to friend any player from any platform and send them gifts and such."
US	4	2015-12-22	1.8.1	Amandeater	Amazing dragons and an overall amazing game!	I'm a huge fan of dragonvale and this game is so wonderful it really stands out amongst the crowd of ever-growing dragon games! Just wish there were easier ways to obtain gems without spending so much money and to add new friends within the game itself! Great game overall though😀💝👊
US	5	2015-12-22	1.8.1	Aze!	Dragon Mania Legends	I am 61 yrs old! I love the game! I'm addicted to it.
US	5	2015-12-21	1.8.1	will.is.epic	Great Game! Tiny problem	So, first off, great game! I highly suggest that you get it. It is very addicting. But, sometimes the starter pack advertisement pops up, and my game crashes.....
US	5	2015-12-21	0	Jurassic Gymnast	Awesome, but could improve	I love dragon mania legends and I've gotten some of my friends addicted to it. They play more than me because I do a lot of things after school. After every update, it doesn't let me log on for a day or two. I don't like the way you go down in levels / leagues in the battle arena. overall this is a great game, but they should fix a few things. 👍🏻🐉

US	3	2015-12-20	1.8.1	nihilus_revan	Its a good game. But..	I really like this game but there are too many adds. And thats bad for a generation ipod like mine. They keep crashing my game and making it to where i HAVE to restart my ipod to play it again. Happens 10 times a day. I hate it

US	4	2015-12-18	1.8.1	Ash3785795	Great game... But there are some bugs.	I've been playing dragon mania legends for awhile now and I can say I only have one complaint... The option to watch adds for gems has been a buggy for awhile and now, only half the time actually works. It should have been fixed by now so I'm starting to think it may be a rip off.
US	5	2015-12-18	1.8.1	foxfan1!!	BEST GAME EVER!!!!	SO ITS PRETTY COOL THAT YOU CAN FIGHT VIKINGS AND RAISE YOUR OWN DRAGONS IN YOUR OWN TOWN, SO I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
US	5	2015-12-17	0	tvd_official	Addictive, but...	I do not like how you go down in the arena battles because I'm not always on because of school and extra curricular activities. I also suggest that it should not be energy but lives so every time you lose a battle you lose a life. Other than that I think that this game is super addictive!!

US	4	2015-12-14	1.8.1	JustGresh	Solid Game	I enjoy it. Bundles over priced for things you can obtain just by waiting. Do like turn based gameplay and the fact that your base doesn't get attacked. Breeding dragons is pretty cool. It's like a new age Pokemon.
US	5	2015-12-13	1.8.1	Glittergurl42	Amazing game!!!	The best city builder I've played by far, it's actually better than Dragon City by a far. If you love city builders and dragons this is a must have app! As far as bugs go I haven't came across any but they will be reported if found.
US	4	2015-12-13	1.8.1	Drewskilicious	Good but one bug	This game is great but me and my friends have had one problem and that is we can't add anymore friends seems like we max out at 2 friends then the bar to input a friends code is no longer there. If that could be fixed this game would be awesome.
US	5	2015-12-13	1.8.1	Matt927	Very cool	Great game! Challenging without being ridiculous and requiring someone to spend inordinate amounts of cash to progress. Have spent a total of $1.99 which is a small price to pay for such a good game
US	5	2015-12-13	1.8.1	watsonsax	Dragocrazy	Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
US	1	2015-12-13	1.8.1	No gems!!	TOO OVERPRICEDDDD	This game is way to overpriced, it's not even worth it, it's $100 for 3,800 gems and legendary dragons cost 3,200 gems. Please consider lowering the prices because not all people come from money. please look at the prices of clash of clans, $100 for 14000 gems, I know that the company has to make money but I think ur making a little TOO much money, your basically scamming people because you tubers need to make good videos and they have to buy gems to do so, for example jaylew, she is a great you tuber and your basically taking her money because she HAS TO buy the gems for her viewers, She even gives away free gems
US	4	2015-12-13	1.8.1	LyssyLovee	Addicting! But one request...	I love this game so much! So fun ; I'm addicted! I just have one request... I would like to be able to change the name of my dragon. That would be a big improvement !

I love that it's not one of those games where you're on it for 5 minutes and then have to wait for hours to have something else to do! I don't have any problems with the game crashing like others have said. I just wish that there was a way to get rid of an egg you don't want immediately after breeding and before actually hatching it. I always have dragons finished breeding before my egg is done hatching and the hatchery upgrades are so expensive! Other than that, it's a really fun game.

US	5	2015-12-08	1.8.1	25thundercat	Amazing game!	I love this game so much! It has plenty to do, and it isn't as necessary to use real money as it is in most other games. Though I do have one suggestion; being able to name your dragons would be sweet. Other than that, this game is great!
US	4	2015-12-08	1.8.1	Megthemasyer	Please Read IMPORTANT!	I'm coming to you honestly, in this game there is a few problems. Don't get me wrong it's addicting but every time I going to my habitat to feed my dragons it closes the game and then I can make it back in for a few minutes, has any of this happened to anyone else?

But recently I've noticed that when I try to load the game, it keeps crashing. I've rebooted and tried to reload the game many times but it still is crashing. Please fix this problem! I still want to play this game!

I give this game one satr for that becaude the main reason I play games if to compete and ally with my friends. How am I supposed to do that when most of my friends have samsung devices and I have an apple device?

US	5	2015-12-06	1.8.1	DaJoseTemple	Happy Happy Joy Joy	"Super fun game. So much thought went into this app. Surprised it wasn't named / supported or titled by how to train your dragon because the artwork is just as beautiful. The UI, user interface, is very well done. The only thing I can say to improve it would be to create a way users to share resources other than gifting. Like a bazaar or a ""vacation"" spot for dragons not used that our friends can trade like cards. Oo also maybe a later update would be a store where you can bring in armor, jewelry, things infused with magic that can be put on the dragons similar to Diablo or the app Knights and Dragons. Anyhow, I really enjoy playing your game. Keep up the good work!"
US	3	2015-12-06	0	BrittRae13	Fun but consuming	It's fun to play but timers for everything make the game play almost boring because they are so long. It gets harder to play without spending money the more you level up because you need so much resources and the wait time to get them is long. I enjoy it but only end up being able to play for less than 30 mins at a time until I run out of things I can do.

US	1	2015-12-04	1.8.1	Drew145022	Good but cost 2000$	The game play is great there are a lot of thing you can easily fall in love with on the game but the developers have really dropped the ball with pricing. It would cost you 2000 dollars to level up and that is only if you buy at 100$ at a time. If you buy smaller packages it would easily cost you double to triple the cost. The game is not worth the money.

US	5	2015-12-03	1.8.1	Armstrong456	Great game!	The games is pretty fun, but it lags. There I was, fighting off dragons and being awesome, then it lags, kicks me out, and now I have no more energy for fighting dragons. But other than that, it's really fun! Besides the amount of gems you have to pay to do the cool stuff. But the breeding! It's so awesome! Besides the waiting. All I had to do was breed my agent dragon and my elemental dragon and bam(!) I got a Mercury dragon (ps those are super rare.)!
US	5	2015-12-03	0	How-Ar-U	Addicting...but w/ minor issues	"I'm surprised there's actually one ""raise-and-train"" kind of game being NOT a straight-down money hole!
This game is a BLESSING!!
You've got plenty of things to do w/o handing in any of your cash!!!
(granting that, money-free gameplay might become extremely difficult to progress after dragons raised to lvl 23+ (￣▽￣)...... At least will not happen in first 60 play days)

That being said, some annoying
problems are:
1) disconnect all of a sudden w/o refunding your energy point
(& empty your farm progress w/o warnings...c'mma seriously!?).
2) like others said, game will match you up to IMPOSSIBLY HARD opponents who will deal you a one-hit-death blow!
3) exploring ruins turn out to be very unrewarding w/ the lame prize & much time involved, and worst of all, for doing that you're forced to level up those kind of dragons you don't want them to be very high levels ˊ_>ˋ"

US	3	2015-12-01	0	MaylRoll	Review For Dragon Mania Legends	"As a person who has been playing daily almost since the game's launch (about 10 months or so) and just deleted the game, I think a review is finally in order. The game is beautiful; there's absolutely no doubt about that. The battle system isn't always perfect, but for the most part it's a decent turn-based system nonetheless. The majority of dragon designs are lackluster; this game harbors some of the ugliest dragons I've encountered in gaming, but the graphics and art style themselves pick up some of the slack (though some designs just couldn't be saved). The lack of good dragon designs also makes breeding somewhat less exciting, and the wait times can get extremely long for both breeding and hatching.

Initially, the game is very cute, competitive, fun... and extremely addicting. My first few months playing were certainly my happiest. But as I grew as a player and the updates rolled out, I began to realize that the game is a huge money-grabber, and the company, Gameloft, cared little to none about the free player base, even the hardworking and dedicated ones who couldn't afford or simply didn't want to pay. Higher-level events are dominated by people who spend the most money on the game; the regular events tend to actually be more of an auction rather than a competition. At only 10-20 spots for the grand prize, casual players can absolutely forget about winning or even competing in these events, virtually making this game pay-to-win.

The feeding / leveling system is awful. The game starts off hard to get food. And it stays that way.  Only it gets much, much worse later on because your dragons are greedy little gluttons and demand exponentially more food per level. If you're a free player (as I was), you will not get three dragons to max level in a YEAR. Three dragons. One team. Not even max level within 365 days. I've played daily for ten months and my team was 58, 56, and 56, all requiring nearly 4 million food per level (with the max level being 70). My next highest dragon was level 35, and the rest were lower. It's pretty dang bad. And the worst part about it is that you can't swap out your team's dragons without wasting a bunch of time collecting food for and feeding your desired new dragon(s). After a certain point in the game, you're stuck with the team you have, virtually unable to switch any member out for a different dragon without starting over. The company boasts having over 100 different dragons, but what they don't tell you is that you can only use 2 or 3, pretty much permanently, if you want to get far in the game in a reasonable time period (a year).

Furthermore, the game is expensive. It costs 2 Gems to speed-breed a Fire dragon. Fire dragons take 30 seconds to breed. 2 Gems for 30 seconds, and they really don't even give you many Gems in-game (especially after you clear all the achievements and dragon collections). Dragons can cost up to 125 Gems to speed up the process for, which is insane. Accelerating food growth can cost about 100 Gems or so (for just one farm, and there are 12 farms in all). Even turning your dragon into a baby again after it becomes an adult costs 15 Gems per dragon (and the baby dragon form is only available for viewing in its habitat). 

The game caters to younger, naive players and punishes older players with higher level dragons. From being able to gain much fewer Gems in-game to having it harder in battles and having much less material with very little replay value, older and more experienced players have it rough. The game gets boring, but remains addicting. So you still spend a lot of time collecting Gold and Food, breeding, and battling, but there's not much else to do. It becomes an unsatisfying, tedious, repetitive experience, but you don't stop because it's addictive and you've already put a lot of time in. There's not enough fun, lasting things to do for older players. All that they have for you is collection and an occasional battle when you collect enough food to level up your dragons a little.

However, above all, my biggest problem, and ultimately why I decided to delete the game, is because to me, Gameloft is way too greedy and disrespectful towards their consumers / customers. They don't often listen to their players, and in the few instances that they do, they implement the players' ideas in weird ways. For example, people asked for a collect all Gold button in the past. In the most recent update, Gameloft actually implemented it. Yep, and all you have to do is spend a minimum of $200 on Gems to unlock it, as well as pay 25 million Gold to buy it from the shop. And also, it has a 6 hour cooldown after use. Because all of those things were really what everyone was asking for when they requested a Gold collection button. The sole reason I played for free is because I simply didn't like Gameloft, and even if they made a pretty game, I didn't want to support what I deemed to be unacceptable behavior from a company. And, since they never changed and treated us more respectfully (and probably never will), I will not be buying anything from them and will never download one of their games again.

Overall, I give Dragon Mania Legends three stars. Plus three stars because it's a good game with great graphics, a nice player community, and a lot to do at first. Minus a star for lack of replay value, the fact that it became tediously boring, the fact that the game is frustrating at times, and the fact that it has some major flaws in balance and mechanics. Minus a star for bad customer service / company interaction. I would not recommend this game to anyone."

US	4	2015-11-27	1.8.0	Shineterribleterror	My Favorite Dragon Game, but...	"First I'll list all the good things and then the bad things. I have downloaded a few dragon games in the past and they hurl quests at you that should be given to you farther in the game. One game even said to buy a ""starter pack"", which requires real money to buy! Evil! 👿 This game has in-app purchases, but you do not need to buy them because it is so easy to get coins (and gems!) in the game. You can simply tickle the dragons or win battles to get coins, and do achievements or complete a section in the dragon codex to get gems. See? Easy. And to get food you can win battles or grow food at the farm, which is surprisingly cheap. To feed your dragons you don't need to press that annoying ""feed"" button to feed them, you actually feed them. You grab some food from the basket and throw it over to the dragon. Or you can just drag it over to your dragon. Cute, huh? There is just so much more to note! The dragons look like dragons! In some games there were some so-called dragons that looked like they weren't even dragons. One just looked like a penguin with wings and horns! These dragons look like they are real dragons! Oh there is even more! Breeding. Breeding is fun and easy. You take two dragons and see what happens! The wait times are super long, but usually it's totally worth it! And you know in other dragon games when you're battling, and you only can fight with one dragon? In this game you can fight with THREE! Oh and the graphics are amazing! For once it  looks like the attack actually hits the other dragon!  My favorite part of the game is kinda weird. It's that when you get money, food, or gems, it literally flies from the source into the particular bar. Another cool thing is that most of the graphics are 3D and it never glitches! Never crashes! There are no bugs! This game is so cool and awesome! Thank you so much, Gameloft, for putting this awesome game in existence! I totally recommend this, and keep those updates coming!😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😀😀😀😀😃😃😃 I love this game! So addicting!

BUT... I have come to a point in the game where I have messed up the game entirely and I want to restart the game from scratch... I have an iCloud account so everything I've tried won't work. My parents won't let me have a Facebook account because I'm only 11. I'd like you to add a delete game option so I can reset. Make it a red button and when a player clicks it give prompts,so they can make a final decision on whether or not to delete the data. Thank you and I will be waiting for this. For now, I'll try and find other ways to delete the game, even with an iCloud account and no Facebook account."

2. You should have a rename option since I have a dust dragon and it's name is Dave (I want my dragon 2 be a girl
3. When you try to pet a dragon it sometimes says no rewards until...! I do not want rewards! I want to make my dragon happy!

US	3	2015-11-25	0	Goofy Grandma 0	Dragon Mania Legends	I'm having fun playing the game at the moment I've only been playing for 4 days. This game is money sucking which is to bad because I would love to play all the way through but I know I won't. You need way to much food to raise your dragons levels, yes you can make food but then you need a lot of money. I would play this game if it was the only game I was putting me net into but it's not so I will have to play city and choose. I'll probably put this one on the back burner for a later time to play.
US	4	2015-11-24	1.8.0	Sneak916	Great game.. So far	Pretty fun so far I like how it has the feel of dragon city mixed with monster legends, one thing I see tat could be a nuisance is the VIP system. Why even have that? It takes most of your gems just so you can have a few upgrades or perks. Other than that great game, beautiful graphics
US	2	2015-11-24	1.8.0	NemuiNeko	Too many ads	I didn't used to get this many, but now every time I finish a battle I get an ad, every time I open something I get an ad, after clicking a few things I get an ad. Sometimes they sneak up on me and I click one and get taken out of the game and then I have to wait as the game reloads. It's really trying my patience and I'll probably end up deleting it if it stays this bad.

US	3	2015-11-22	1.8.0	Kitty-Cat ATTACK!	Almost perfect	"I love this game a lot, but I have a few suggestions to make that you could possibly make for the next update. 

1.) I have a lot of islands and habitats, but I really don't want to spend all this time to collect the gold. But I don't want to spend lots of money on a VIP pass just to get something to make that happen. Please make it so where anyone can buy it on the market for not that much coins please.

2.) I wish there was a VIP pass that won't expire, that is affordable, and not expensive. 

3.) I wish you guys could do a legendary dragon giveaway where you get one totally random legendary. 

4.) I wish to be able to add more friends without them adding me. You probably don't get that, but I was only able to enter one friend code, but then after that, the button for that disappeared! I had to tell my friends to add my friend code to theirs, but now they can't add anymore friends. Please let us be able to enter as many friend codes as we like please.

4.) I would really appreciate if you could battle with your friends. I always want to battle with friends, but we are never in the same dragon league, so we can't. Please add!

5.) It would be awesome if you could name the dragons. I always want to name mine, but too bad a name is randomly chosen and I can't change it.

6.) If you could gift dragons to your friends, that would be super awesome. I have lots of dragons in my inventory that I need to get rid of.

7.) I wish you didn't have to just feed your dragon to level up. What if winning battles made the dragon stronger or something like that.

8.) It would be so cool if you could make special dragons for the holidays and give them away free on that holiday. Maybe for a Christmas one could be Gingerbread Dragon (I don't think it has been made yet at least).

9.) What if you could add a new dragon element like ice or magic or something else. I really like the new ones like light and dark. I would really like two new ones please.

10.) What if the dragons on the market when you hit the info, it gives you a hint on how to breed them. I am trying to get a lot of the rare dragons, but I am terrible at it and only own two of them. 

11.) There should be a thing like the dragon league, but you could battle with real players actually controlling their dragons, and you could get a ribbon or something when you win and the more ribbons you get, the more prizes you win.

12.) Please get rid of the adds. They are annoying

13.) Lastly, I wish the stuff like gems I'm he game was not so expensive. The dragon of the week/month are way to expensive. I would like them very much, but I can't afford it!

Now please consider this. This took an hour to write. Literally! I did not just write this to be ignored! Would gameloft just listen to what people want for once?!"
US	5	2015-11-22	1.8.0	Aly🤗	GREAT GAME	Love it
US	2	2015-11-22	1.8.0	Firecap526	Not recommended	The app was ok at first but takes a long time to create new dragons and often lose battle points due to the game disconnecting mid battle. Angered me quite often when I needed one more win for a bonus and couldn't continue the win streak bc it disconnects.
US	5	2015-11-22	0	Care & Feeding of Dragons	Great Game!	This has been an excellent game since I got the 1 click buying option turned off.  I am a 68 year old grandma & hate to admit I am addicted.  My grand children got me into the game.  Of course, they were also the problem with 1 click buying.  I try to get as many new dragons I can & then let the grand kids feed them. They like to fight them also.  We find this game far superior to Dragon Story.  It is interesting, challenging & very playable since there is space to add new habitats & options for being able to purchase new habitats.

US	5	2015-11-21	1.8.0	snailmera	This app is cute!	It's really fun and the art is cute! I'm really enjoying it so far.
US	4	2015-11-21	1.8.0	Awesome Pony girl🐴❤️	Meh	Could MOST definitely be better, the boss levels should be made a bit more easily. Also give us more power to play in competitions. And make it less gems to refill!!! 🤔🤐
US	5	2015-11-21	1.8.0	kuddlykat123	Non-stop Fun!!!	This game is both fun and interesting. Graphics isn't bad either. As fun as Minecraft.
US	3	2015-11-20	1.8.0	LiAmber Nichole	No Easy Way to add friends (Non-Facebook)	All in all great game. In app purchases, way too expensive though. As much as this app charges to buy a usable amount of purple gems you'd think there would be a simpler way to add new friends besides going through the their forum. 👎🏼
US	5	2015-11-20	1.8.0	MJH31016	LOVE THIS!!!	It's like Dragon Vale but you can battle too

US	5	2015-11-20	1.8.0	Ghhgdhnbvfthj32	AMAZING one idea though	My friend told me about this game and I LOVE it ❤️ but my idea is what if you get a dragon and you already have it. Instead of selling it we could send it to our friends!! That would be awesome!!!!!!!!!
US	5	2015-11-20	1.8.0	Cinnandging	Good game	I have had the game before and I loved it, even if the dragons didn't look cute any more, I loved the game either way. I have been reading and come on people, they are trying the best they can so calm down. On the other hand yes ads are annoying but it's not a big deal, yes you need to pay for vip but who cares play without it. Honestly I think the game is great.

US	2	2015-11-19	1.8.0	WRhyne	Poor connectivity a problem	I'm giving this app a 2 star and not a 1 star because I love the fight system in general. With that in mind a deplore the fact that if for a brief second my connection goes bad I lose all my progress in a fight..... They need come up with a way that doesn't require you to have a constant internet connection to play dml.

Well other than that minor issue this game is amazing and I hope other people feel the same
US	5	2015-11-18	1.8.0	That kid jace	A good idea for the next update	This game is awesome I think in the future up date make it were you can bye more hatcheries and breeding dens. I am trying to breed the tribal dragon this game is awesome and keep up the good work

US	3	2015-11-17	1.8.0	Gdsjenny	Game is good, ads are frequent	I enjoy the game, but I don't play for long stints because the ads are very frequent and repetitive.  It seems like the ads (full screen) load every 5 mins and they are the same thing every time for a few weeks.  Currently the ad is for a PBS special.  I saw it, I shared it with my kids, my kids are excited, I don't want to see the ad again in 5 mins.

Can't disable them so you have to be careful. Can't play the campaign map cause it crashes all the time. I really like playing this on my laptop but not on my iPod so can't recommend this game.
US	4	2015-11-17	1.8.0	Elvjav	It's great but...	I love this game. The battling system is great, the artwork and animation is flawless, and I love petting my dragons. But. I cannot get the dragon codex for a reason unexplained by gameloft and the rewards for the VIP level I am in, weren't rewarded. Plus that system is pretty messed up. I still recommend the game, but this mistakes need to be fixed.

US	5	2015-11-17	1.8.0	ShayEsslin84	Surprisingly Fun	Got it for the kids, then took it over. It's fun, I like completing the quests. The amount of gems required for some upgrades and dragons is a ridiculous, but expected. Good way to pass time. HOWEVER, I hate the fact that I have to use Facebook to have friends. That absolutely needs to be fixed, I should be able to add friends that are on the near me menu, or by code.
US	5	2015-11-17	0	Jesusgirl04	Fun, Exciting and Addicting	I got hooked on Dragons ML after my husband had been playing for a while. I love the graphics, the imagination of designers of the dragons. The fights and side quests are fun. I love the extra challenges. My only complaint is the number of pop-up ads that have cropped up during game play. It's extremely frustrating and unnecessary.
US	3	2015-11-16	1.7.0	Alexmporaidio	Best game ever	"So you are trying to get a report. We 
can tell you every thing about dragon so sometimes they can be nice. In dragons Ml  you can earn every thing that are in there.So if you turn the game all the way you can earn more coins and points.If you breed wind and fire makes the bee dragon.I named my bee dragon Roxie."

Same stuff needs fixing. But this is my favorite app and I ain't giving it up.  Just play it. You'll love it.

7/20/15 Update 

I'm at level 16/17(can't remember at the moment...) & I bought the Marsh island. I found out that you need like millions of gold just to clear the island. Small flowers now cost 8,000 gold to clear!!! Trees cost 90,000 gold to clear!!! What the heck happened?! You just sextupled(?) the amount of gold needed to clear the island so we can place more habitats, farms and other stuff! That's so ridiculously expensive. Can you please make the cost of clearing trees and stuff the same amount as on our first island? Cause I don't mind spending a couple of dollars on this game, but I don't think I can for much longer....

Also, please let us get more food for our gold. 1,500 food for 15,000 gold is too expensive for that amount of food. We should AT LEAST get 10,000 food for that amount of gold.

We also should not have to wait for 5 or 6 hours for our dragons to breed and then have to wait ANOTHER 11 hours or so for it to hatch. That's way too much time; especially if you're trying to get a certain dragon for your quests. Please let us have shorter times for our dragons to hatch?

We need more food, gems, and gold for me to spend REAL MONEY on the game. We should get 800 gems for $9.99 and so on and so forth. I just realized we haven't been getting a lot of what ever item we spend REAL MONEY on disappears rather quickly after bought. Trust me, I don't mind spending money on this game; as it's rapidly becoming one of my favorite apps. I just want more for my money.

Those are the reasons for me rating this app 3 stars instead of 5. Please implement these changes to the game.

************
I love it! I love how you get to interact with your dragons. Plus, you earn gold by doing it. The battles are kind of glitchy for me sometimes. But other than that it's fun. Oh, but you need to give us more food for our gold though. That needs to be fixed. We don't get a lot of food for our dragons, especially the first amount. It gets worse as it takes a lot of food to feed them so that they level up faster. 

Anybody playing this. If you need friends, you can add me. My Gamecenter ID is: or devylzangyl"
US	5	2015-11-12	1.7.0	Thundroer	Favourite game😍😍😍😍	It is a fun game but please,please decrease the rate of islands so that players can buy it easily and please make us able to upgrade hatchery with coins not gems.😠😠

US	3	2015-11-11	1.7.0	Creativeruddyy	Expensive	"It's extremely expensive to level up your dragons. Everything in this game is about MONEY! You people are so greedy. I guess that's because we live in a capitalistic world. Other than the price, it takes extremely long for thing to finish. It has you waiting hours and hours. All it does is make you want to use real money.... Which is pointless because your always going to be behind no matter what. There are challenges with other people around the world, but if those people use real money, your not gonna win. That's what people do. Your always going to be disappointed. And when you battle other people, there's a ""hard"", ""easy"", and ""medium"" label underneath them. The ones that are ""easy"" are hard. The ones that are hard are Extremely hard! My dragon is barely level 17 and the others 16. How can I go up against someOne on ""medium"" if their dragons level is ""20"" ? How is that medium? That's impossible, unless once again, you use REAL MONEY to win. It's complete nonsense. All try want is money. They don't care if you actually enjoy the game."
US	3	2015-11-10	1.7.0	Skyrimisluv	Good but adds get annoying	"Though this game is good, Thier are a few problems that REALLY need to be fixed.the forced ads are extremely glitchy and the one were the second the game starts it will cause the game to crash if u try to X it out and the others that ""Randomly"" pop up seem to pop up conveniently seem to pop up when I'm tapping for food or gold,second this game seems to oftenly lag out which causes you to lose your portal turn and a way 2 fix this is to increase the portal regeneration or patch it so that you can't lose you portal turn if the game is exited out.One last and crucial thing is to increase the number of free gems to at least 5 by watching a video because their may not always be an add. Other than that this game is perfect"

US	1	2015-10-30	0	Eric~42~	The game is ruined	I want to congratulate you all for ruining a game with such promise. Everyday I when I log in, I think to myself, maybe there won't be any advertisements that pop up and I can actually play the game. But.. Of course, I'm met with constant disappointment. You truly have demonstrated that your need for money through pop-up advertisements are more important than your consumers. Good job! If you were so desperate for money, why didn't you just say so? We all rather buy stupid gems instead of dealing with constant pop-ups and advertising that is completely unrelated to the game. Give your self a pat on the back boys, because your best days are certainly behind you.
US	4	2015-10-30	0	Bodragon13	Very average, greedy	"This is just another cookie cutter phone game that uses consumer impatience and dangles pretty baubles to make their money stack grow. Free play is slow play. Good thing I'm patient, because, like most of the world, I can't afford to spend hundreds on games. Gameloft doesn't need my cash. They have enough players who think a new dragon is the best and so they dump real cash into the game like crazy. Dupes.
    Ads. Most games give coins or jewels for watching ads. Not this one. They not only quit giving jewels, but now pop up ads rule the game. I have heard and seen the Walgreens ad so much that I QUIT SHOPPING AT WALGREENS. Just seeing and reading the name sickens me. Oversaturation means Hello CVS!"
US	1	2015-10-30	0	InExplicable69	Sell outs	Used to be a 5 star rating. they recently started doing advertisements just while your playing the game like collecting gold a 30 sec advert will just pop up and you can't exit out until 15 sec later. I just deleted the app and I was level 76.

US	4	2015-10-28	1.7.0	NickRko9	Very Fun	Would recommend. Is fun and worth the time. The battling between dragons is a cool feature.
US	1	2015-10-28	1.7.0	Lost Raven Blue	Do not recommend	The ads have gotten really intrusive lately. The Jelly Belly ads were bad enough, but at least you got a reward for putting up with them. You don't even get that anymore. The new Walgreens ad is 30 goddamned seconds long. That's longer than I even play the game in one sitting for the most part. And god forbid I actually click on it, because then my phone hangs and takes another ten seconds to get out of the app store and actually play again. It is absolutely out of control. Uninstalling this game. Not playing again until this crap is dealt with.

US	3	2015-10-27	1.7.0	Guppylove23	Addictive but ridiculous that you need real money.	"Free my butt! 😒
This is expensive!

There is NO WAY to advance in this game without spending real money.
The prices are outrageous for very little of what you need. Only get this if you have no problem spending real money.....and lots of it! 😤

There are really no instructions telling you how to do anything. Join a Facebook group for advice, you'll need it. You also need to add friends via Game Center.

DL for an addictive yet pricey ""free"" game."

US	4	2015-10-24	1.7.0	Sophie Roweton	Nice!	I love Dragon ML, but I would rate it a 5 star if the dragons looked different. They all just have the same features. The curly ones, the innocent looking ones, such as the plant dragon, the fat looking dragons, and, I'm just saying, I think the dragons just need to look different. Otherwise, AWESOME!
US	5	2015-10-24	1.7.0	Goponies in a rush	awesomeness	im just gonna tell my opinon i say this game is filled with awesomeness
US	5	2015-10-24	1.7.0	The Cosmo	Fun, addictive, adorable.	"Blows dragonvale and dragon city out of the water. I got tired of these types of games long ago, but i am a dragon fanatic, so i couldnt help but try. Ads were annoying, but after a cheap startup pack for 2$ i got a sweet little head start and no more ads! They are plentiful. 
Con- for some reason gameloft decided the we will now download extra info midgame and cut out access to certain features until we do. If youre an idiot, this is brilliant. Lets make people stop playing the game whilst traveling. 
All in all this game is quite packed with goodies, a rediculous amount of breeding combos, and a quazi-pokemon fighting system. The artwork is done quite well given the program used to run it, and ill will be playing for much time to come. I recommend to any who like civilization games, pokemon, dragons, art, or just generally being cool."

US	5	2015-10-22	1.7.0	MFinell	Fun game, makes the time fly by!	My daughter and I enjoy playing the game, the ads distract from the overall experience, but u just exit and then end the ad when it asks you.
US	1	2015-10-22	1.7.0	10Bubbie	Review off a ripoff	Really is a rip off. Beautifully designed but a rip off. Hoped that it would quit being all about only making money and become a more fun game but it never did. Truly sad, so long
US	5	2015-10-22	1.7.0	Heatherlo1982	Like the game	Like the game but the advertising that pops up when you are trying to play HAS TO GO it actually makes me very frustrated
US	5	2015-10-22	1.7.0	1432one	Amazing. TIP TO AVOID ADS	"This game has the cutest dragons ever. Much better than Dragonvale. It has really amazing graphics, and you can see details very clearly. You can also pet your dragons--which is new. Also the dragons look a bit 3D! I love it!!!
Plus, if the same old annoying ad comes up, just exit the game then go back. It should say ""Are you sure you want to exit these video”?
Click yes, and then the ad goes away."
US	3	2015-10-21	1.7.0	SixthLeafClover	Very cute but hate ads	I like this game a lot for the dragons. But this is the first time I have come back to rate a game down due to movie ads. I really dislike them and it ruins the gaming experience. Get rid of ads because the game feels cheap with ads.

US	5	2015-10-18	1.7.0	Bob Buckleberry	TOTALLY EPIC	This game is awesome. It is easy to make money, but not too easy so that you just spend it without thinking twice about it. I just wish the campaign mode was a bit easier.
US	5	2015-10-18	1.7.0	Peeps_are_awesome	I love this game!	This game is awesome the only thing I wish they could change is when you pet the dragons and your done getting money from them I wish you could pet them more or play games with the dragon but either way this is still my favorite game!

Used to be a great game until game loft got greedy and raised the food prices and gold prices right now it's a joke those event dragons u have to pay to obtain them the events are jokes only people that spend tons of money each month can compete great game if u like to spend tons of money.so many games are pay to win these days it sad really and this is 1 of them
US	5	2015-10-16	1.7.0	Jebon07	Fun but now I can't play it	When I first played dragon mania, I had so much fun x3.but now that It udated to only be played on ios 7 and above, I can't play it anymore.I live where USD is really expensive, so my brother can't afford to update my ipad. So, please make it be able to be played on ios 6.
US	3	2015-10-16	1.7.0	FloopityDoopity	Pretty good but...	The lack of diversity in dragons is jarring. They all look different but they all play the same with identical move sets. The dragons have some great designs but nothing that makes them special. I find that kind of disappointing. The only other thing I will mention is the ads. They are obnoxious and pop up at random hoping you will accidentally click on them. I'm rather sick of accidentally being redirected to the CSI slot games...I think that's the worst part of this game. Intrusive ads. Seriously...
US	5	2015-10-15	1.7.0	jakndna	Game	Fun game -chase

US	4	2015-10-14	1.7.0	jamesjw2	Nice	"I love the game, but it could be better... Maybe you could name the dragons, 
maybe add minigames? Also, you shouldn't have to spend so many gems and gold, make the breeding times shorter, the contests longer, and better dragons easier to get? And things
shouldn't have to cost so much real money. But besides those flaws the game is great!"
US	5	2015-10-14	1.7.0	Tonde Tori	Awesome	I like thins game lot it's very good and cute I love thank you
US	5	2015-10-14	1.7.0	ShaddowKnuckle	Super Fun!!!!	A great game, not a cash grab. Everything that can be bought with cash CAN be earned in game 👍
US	4	2015-10-13	1.7.0	12345;:()	Fun	I love this game.  It's a lot of fun seeing what you getting with the breeding of the eggs.  Lots of different thing to keep you playing. Just be careful you don't stay up until 4 am playing lol... Have fun and enjoy the game..
US	1	2015-10-13	1.7.0	Sgiathatch	Broken	"The game worked great for a while but now it crashes before it can get past the splash screen. On an iPhone 6 with iOS 8.4.1 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 9

Addendum - the constant ads are annoying. I shouldn't see ads for other games every 2-3 minutes when playing"
US	5	2015-10-13	1.7.0	krazywithguns	It's so much fun!	I love it and I have so much fun on it I'm hoping you will love dragon mania legends as much as I do
US	5	2015-10-13	1.7.0	Luv2bme22	Favorite Game🎮	I absolutely love the game!! I just think you should be able to name the dragons. I also think new islands should be added because I have a friend who is running low on space. The major flaw in the game is the ads, way too many. It's the same ad every. single. time. Get this, I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THE DAMG MOVIE. Now if it was just pop-ups, eh, okay... but now If I click on one single thing a 30 freaking second long ad will pop. I know everybody has to pay bills, but the ads need to be decreased at least a little bit. Also, my videos (to get gems) are glitching and disappearing, occasionally they will come back, but it will allow me to watch the ads and gain 3xs more of the gems. Aside all of that, this is a really fun and addicting game and it never ever crashes. I highly recommend it👍🏻
US	5	2015-10-12	1.7.0	Stephcrz	Love it	Awesome!
US	5	2015-10-12	1.7.0	Elizabeth0317	I love this game	This is the best game ever because I started 1 month ago and now I'm on level 19 and I have 2 million coins and 2,000 gems
US	5	2015-10-12	1.7.0	Riley Buchman	Awsome dragons!	I love dragon mania legend but cut down on the adds people!
US	3	2015-10-12	1.7.0	Wowzas15	Hard to make friends	"I wish it were easier to make friends. None of my friends in real life play games like these, so I have to find online communities who do. Then in order to play with them, you have to make sure you're playing on the same platform AND become their Facebook friend, and I'd rather not friend a bunch of strangers on my Facebook. There should be an easier way to play with people from all over the world. Maybe they should re-think their redeem codes so that there's no limit on how many codes you can redeem, because that has been the only way I made a friend. Sadly, I can only redeem one code, so I only have one friend. Or perhaps on the ""players near me"" section, there can be a way to send them a game request. I just wish it were easier to make friends. Then the game would be a lot better and more fun to play."
US	5	2015-10-12	1.7.0	Meerkatie	Dragons	Great game. You breed dragons and get different Baby dragons, fight dragons like Pokemon, feed dragons and raise them then give them skills. Very cool.

US	2	2015-10-11	1.7.0	amykck	Bad update :(	"My son and I used to love this game - but being interrupted by advertisements every few minutes is keeping us from playing. Watching the trailers for extra gems was one thing - but this pops up a video with no warning. 

Until that gets resolved, we're taking a break and looking for other games."

US	3	2015-10-11	1.7.0	Silcerstream24	Stop the dang ads!!!!	This game is really fun don't get me wrong, but now it's just getting to a point where every minute is when a thirty second ad will come up. Pop ups are one thing, but videos? Really? I usually watch the videos for gems, but now it's just doing it just to make the player rage it feels like. I don't want to see that dang movie! Seeing the same trailer come up every minute doesn't make a person intrigued. It makes the person want to shoot the advertiser. Think of the players! Not yourselves! All you guys care about is money these days! Please fix this!

It would be one thing if it was just a pop up but after I finish a level or level up a dragon I have to watch a 30 second video. This video is the same. Every. Single. Time. And no I DONT WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE!!! Please reduce the advertisements.

US	3	2015-10-09	1.7.0	Yoda369	Dragon mania Legends	"At first really enjoyed this game.  Took me a month and a LOT OF MONEY to realize that  I was spending over a $100 to win a contest prize worth $20.  Stoopid me kept playing  hoping to  reach high enough level to avoid spending over $100 or per week to chase prizes and lower dragons in dragon mania legends contests.  
     Win a dragon and spend over $50 to raise a level dragon ONE LEVEL. FOOD COSTS TOO MUCH. OR TAKES TOO LONG TOGROW. 
BETTER TO PLAY A LITTLE THEN LET FOOD READY TO HARVEST. 
     THE TREASURE HUNTS ARE A RIPOFF. COSTS SO MUCH TO LEVEL UP DRAGONS TO QUALIFY FOR TREASURE WORTH 20% 
Of what it cost. 
Caution. If you want to reach level 70 you will spend more than $1000 to achieve that for just 3 dragons to fight your way to LEVEL 70. Dragon fury must be used too often to level up

     Rich older players are the desired suckers sought by GAMELOFT. SUCH A SHAME because I enjoyed final fantasy dimensions for just a fraction of what this game cost. 

   If money is not a concern. This is an enjoyable game with great graphics for a turn based game. 

Hope I can find a more affordable game soon.   Sincerely. sucker old fart"

US	1	2015-10-08	1.7.0	suckitsippy	AWFUL GAME IF YOURE NOT RICH	They take NO suggestions, the events are unattainable to anyone who's not spending hundreds on their game. You rarely get a chance to win anything besides 5,000 coins. Not worth it, I recommend another game run by anyone except game loft. They are money hungry scammers.

US	5	2015-10-08	1.7.0	wildfirebf	I love it	I love this game , I like that u can decorate and have battles and I love that ur able to collect the dragons . The only thing that I think will make this game better is if the dragons can evolve to a next lvl and have wings in the lvl well some cuz some look like dinosaurs lol but I still love this game and it's features like the puzzles ^_^

US	5	2015-10-08	1.7.0	TJR976	Love this game!!!	"My son and I love this game!  The graphics are beautiful and we have a blast.  I have only one complaint/suggestion.  In fact we are pleading with you developers to please fix the habitat acquisition/purchasing area!!  We have only recently begun playing and have gotten ""maximum habitats reached 15/15"" on at least 3/4 of the habitats.  Even ones we haven't even leveled up enough to buy.   Thanks for reading and please fix!!!!   ;) Thanks"
US	1	2015-10-06	1.6.0	Dajtrain	Too many ads	Lately adds have started popping up randomly. I'll be looking at my islands, just browsing, and an ad will pop up out of nowhere. And even more recently, video ads are popping up! It wasn't like this for the longest time when I started this game. It's a fun game, but the ads need to go away before I give it a higher score. I was okay with ads when I could choose to watch them to get gems, but popping up randomly while I'm playing? No thank you.

(2) Option to send eggs to your friends for them to hatch.

(3) More decorations; those that come with Turtle's Shell and Tranquil Garden to be available for purchase in-game."

US	5	2015-09-28	1.6.0	Mumsypie	Better since update, but...	"Newest issue is that since I updated my friends totem I have almost stopped getting gifts from friends. This is despite having over 40 friends, and formerly getting about 10 gifts per day. I'm getting 1-3 gifts per day now...??? Even though I have not changed my level of sending gifts and still get requests for help opening gates, etc. Am tired of having to write to customer service about stuff.  :-(.  
The latest update has made it easier to earn diamonds and scrolls... Much needed and appreciated! But I am having trouble finding a way to get to use my newer, but still lower level dragons (which I am excited to take to battle)."

....  the bad part is that the game freezes a lot and connects slow. And nightmare is it RUINS the best part..... It just cost me to loose my war!   I think they can definitely do an upgrade fixing the bug issues.... And a faster connection..... Please cure problems soon!"
US	3	2015-09-23	1.6.0	Jkjntjzbl	Love the game but...	I started the game when my sister got me hooked. Unfortunately I use two different platforms. Unlike most games you can synch with Facebook, this game does not so I have to start all over again. Poor planning and greediness on their part.
US	1	2015-09-22	1.6.0	LarryWash	Garbage game	Filled with Full Screen ads that pop up with no warning and you are constantly clicking them by accident. do NOT download.

US	5	2015-09-21	1.6.0	LocoRoco143	Awesome!	Very cute and fun game! I also like the details in the dragons and habitats.
US	5	2015-09-21	1.6.0	Maddiekitty	More habitats	I absolutely love this game! It is my favorite game on my iPad!! One problem though. I love breeding dragons and want to get all of them, but you can only get 17 habitats! I already have used up all of my habitats and have only been playing for a few months. You should make it where you can have 17 of EACH habitat. The dragons are so cute, I need more than just 17 homes for them. Thank you for making this game, though!!
US	2	2015-09-21	1.6.0	Swaldbiesser	Good gameplay. Terrible programming	The game is fun to play with cute dragons. A big problem occurs if you lose connection with the game server for more than a few seconds, especially during a battle. When this happens (usually several times per day), you are removed from battle and the game resets forfeiting any energy that was spent for the battle. Considering the battles are not real time, there is no reason the app couldn't resync the results after the battle ends. This is just lazy programming.
US	5	2015-09-20	1.6.0	Cjc1116	Great	This game is so good I'm addicted to it good job
US	1	2015-09-20	1.6.0	Melodelia	Unwinnable opponents	Ads in the middle of battles, can't keep growing without buying temples - yuck. The gameplay is good, I love the dragon designs. Oh, yeah, tribal dragon with a head-dress and a rain dance? Nurturing girlie dragon? I can soooooo do without the crap cultural and gender stereotypes; particularly when most of the dragons are well done and equally appealing to everyone. Deleting Deleting Deleting - and not allowing for my kids, either.
US	1	2015-09-20	1.6.0	Beloved1932	So not happy!!!	I like the game, but seriously why the ads. I can't do anything without a pop up causing a crash!!! Lots of other similar games work with no ads!!! I'm probably gonna uninstall because of this!!
US	5	2015-09-20	1.6.0	Bubbie Beagle5768	Dragons🐉	I say Dragon Mania Legends is AMAZING!!!! But one tini tiny problem. HOW DO YOU GET BOSS DRAGONS?! I mean, you have to get a habitat and then the Boss Dragon!!! And there is a goal to get all twelve! You need to spend SOOOOOOOOO much money to get all twelve!!! Even the habitats! Can players just get the Dragon like as a reward, like beating it like twelve times or something? I do NOT want to spend all my money on this game. Please, make it easier. Also I recommend this game. It's like Pokemon and Dragons together! I love both of those things. But the money is so hard to gat and keep. I mean literally just the third island is 3.2 million dollars!!! What the hell?! I barley have enough money to buy two metal dragons!! Try to make the game a LITTLE bit easier.
US	3	2015-09-19	1.6.0	Pandabear12212	Repetitive	This game is getting VERY boring. It's all a routine. Go on the app, collect gold, collect food, fight battles. There's no excitement anymore. I probably will be deleting this app
US	5	2015-09-19	1.6.0	Sherry Blair	Dragons mania legend	I like the game I enjoy watching the dragons grow up they're cute just started playing last night
US	4	2015-09-19	1.6.0	Malamphier	Fix this	I bought the pirate bundle and it showed up that I bought it and now this morning it was gone. Please fix this.
US	4	2015-09-19	1.6.0	I'veneverdonethisbeforelolz	Great game, but I'm me sooo...	WHYYYYYY THE DRAGON ADS? Please make them optional! I didn't have a problem with it, until EVERY TIME I CLOSE THE AD (that pops up AS SOON AS IT LOADS) IT CRASHES. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PLAY THIS GREAT GAME IF IT WON'T PLAY?
US	5	2015-09-19	1.6.0	OBMel	Not just for kids!	Downloaded this game in March as a break time reward for students....and now I'm addicted. Facebook has taken a giant backseat bc I prefer my dragons when I get free time. Actually a bit concerning....and I'm now spending actual money on this game! Careful...it's super addicting!:)
US	2	2015-09-19	1.6.0	Venger1970	Fun game - the recent pop up ads are annoying	"My daughter and I love playing together, however the most recent update is plagued with issues.

The concept and overall game play is fun and well thought out.

The programming team really needs to improve their beta testing.  Things get released with bugs.  The programming is choppy  and prone to freezing up or restarting.

The recent update with the constant pop up movie advertisements is insane.  If my daughter didn't want me to keep playing, I would be inclined to delete this app for this reason alone.

Customer email support is non existent.  I've emailed them a few questions and concerns but have NEVER received any response.

I have not reviewed until now and actually hope someone reads these reviews online and makes some changes."
US	2	2015-09-18	1.6.0	Pyronymph	Use to be a good game	I use to really enjoy this game. It was challenging, not too slow, and not too boring. Now you get interrupted by ads every 3 minutes, no matter what - yes, I have had battles interrupted and lost. Add that on top of the unwinnable challenges... It makes the game pretty much unplayable and frustrating. Bad move.

US	1	2015-09-17	1.6.0	Deathproof1004	Boring	This game is boring, please take it down.
US	5	2015-09-17	1.6.0	DogLovingKei	So fun‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️	"I just downloaded this and I already LOVE it! Like LOVE LOVE it! The dragons are so cute! Fighting other dragons that the Vikings stole is awesome! I've got so much done, and it gets harder the more levels you beat when you fight. Though I realized when you fight, you lose 1 energy. But I just found that out, so I have no. 
clue how to get more energy,but this game is AMAZING.If you love dragons, breeding them,feeding them, petting them, having them battle and all that stuff, DOWNLOAD this!"
US	4	2015-09-17	1.6.0	KMouse15	Lot of potential	"Graphics are great, animation is smooth, and dragons are imaginative and cute. However, there is so much pressure to spend money that it detracts from the game. It is tedious and time- consuming to get food, and you don't get more food for your coins with upgrades so there is no motivation to get them. 
Also, while most ads are appropriate, the full screen ads that randomly pop up on the world map are obnoxious. Great game, one of the better ones-- but you guys could do much better. If it was more reasonable, I might actually want to spend real money."
US	4	2015-09-17		Whisperer 50	Fun and addicting	I enjoy playing this game and like how many different off dragons there are.  I would like to see the amount of food needed to level up be changed.  3000 at a time is a bit much

It loads and loads and when it finally seems like I'll get in, I can see my park, it suddenly returns to the loading screen again. And it just seems to constantly be loading. I had a lot of fun with this game though, I loved playing it.

US	5	2015-09-13	1.6.0	Homiezzzzz	Great game. Really just	After the new update. Every other thing you press while playing the game has a video commercial behind it for 15-30 seconds. It's really pissing me off. Remove that crap or I'll remove this game of my iPad.  If I want Jem's I'll happily watch the commercials but other then that. Stop playing them anytime you want.
US	5	2015-09-13	1.5.1	Kitty Kove	DragonML®	This game is so addicting and I can't stop playing. I'm a farm girl, and most of my time is outside working. But when I get free time, I play this. I should doing whatever I want like playing my drums, or swimming in my pool, or just enjoying Fall. But I play this. Not every free time, but sometimes. It's a great game, GameLoft. But sorry, needs some work, because I'm starting to forget about playing it.
US	5	2015-09-13		Dr fjfbdidgd	Love it	Love it
US	4	2015-09-13		Mommenow	Easier to add friends	"So...I love this game. Unfortunately, the ""add friend"" portion of this game is horrible. There are so many games out there with much better friend options, why does this game lack in that area? Other than that it is very fun!"
US	4	2015-09-13		musikgrl21	Lol fun	Lol I've only been playing for a week or so... But I like it so far ;)
US	4	2015-09-12	1.6.0	Hartlysbjm	Casual MOBA	The battles can get a bit tedious, boring. The sprites attacks, graphic wise, aren't very exciting, and do not have any variations. The game designers need to work a little harder on that. Similar to Pokemon with the tactical aspect of gameplay, but you don't have to think much when in battle. You don't have to memories moves, or types like in Pokemon as it tells you during gameplay. This game is a little bit of everything, and that's part of the problem. I think the designers were looking to make the game interesting by making so many things to do, but they really didn't spend much time on any individual thing besides the sprite designs. I can see they are coming out with better, more elaborate updates, so hopefully, they'll make the smaller aspects of the game like farming, training, and move training more exciting and interactive.
US	5	2015-09-12	1.6.0	Distraught Dragon	Goodbye free time!	This game is so addicting and I should know better. I am a college majoring in mathematics and I spend most of my time playing this than studying! The game is really enjoyable making me play this rather than study to keep my precious 4.0. If you love dragons, this is a game for you. The many dragons in this game are so cute! You can even pet them! Man, I should really be studying instead of playing and writing this review right now... Anyway this game gets a 10/10 from me! But beware, you will become addicted to this game! So kiss your priorities goodbye as you say hello to your new virtual home!
US	2	2015-09-12	1.6.0	Woodstock Holly	Was having fun untill update	The game is a lot of fun aside from having to almost buy stuff to get through certain areas. The store is not reliable as it charges you for a certain amount of gems but then you get less than the amount you paid for. Also freezes during games at times and you will lose your portal turn.  Now we updated it today and it immediately crashes. My daughter was looking forward to playing it over the weekend. She has iTouch 4th Gen which worked fine before the update. I hope they make some improvements because the concept is fun and graphics are great!

US	4	2015-09-12		Sir Toki	Lots of fun	This game is great!  Like said in other reviews this is an addicting game. However some small things are missing in the game like a cancel option while breeding. Would be nice if things from level five and up didn't take half a day, or costed ungodly amounts of gems/coins.
US	2	2015-09-12		Sis Pie	Food	Food to hard to accumulate, difficult to level up

US	5	2015-09-12		SuperCotton	Great Game	Super addicting, super fun and easy to play.
US	3	2015-09-12		Supermom8284	Just a Breeder	I came into this game just as the creators decided to restructure the game.  I feel the game is difficult to enjoy as all the events are difficult to progress through and unless you are willing to spend money, lots of it, you basically wind up just breeding and collecting dragons like in DragonVale.  I Love DragonVale due to the challenge of acquiring the dragons and their graphics are awesome.  With this being said, I do like Dragon ML, their dragons are cute and their habitats are nice.  I do enjoy fighting other dragons and on occasion I do this.  I would participate more fully if the scrolls weren't so difficult to get and I didn't have to retake areas I'd just concord all the time.  I've waited a long time to write this review, wanted to give the developers time to work out the kinks and they have in a few areas, but on the hole, I don't enjoy this game nearly as much as I thought I would when I first started playing.  Getting neighbors is difficult and there is really no reason to visit anyone else's place because there is no incentive to visit in the first place.  Once you've seen their world, why keep going back.  If I could give the game a 2 1/2 star rating I would, I don't think 2 stars is right, but neither do I think the game deserves 3 stars either.  Wow, this review has never posted, so once again I'm being asked to review this gam.  , so, I do like the latest updates to the game, so I am a bit more hopeful that the game is going to improve all over.  I am changing my rating to 3 stars and if this review posts, I'll gladly  come back and share my thoughts about the game at a later date!

US	3	2015-09-12		Hekapappy	Still waiting for the food fixing...	Because the amount of food needed for level ups is excessive and it's really interfering with my gameplay.
US	4	2015-09-11	1.6.0	Dolphin1954	Great game!	This is a great game to occupy your time. The only thing negative I can say about it is, I wish that it was a little bit easier to get the specialty dragons like Dragon of the month. Making purchases are not necessary, but you can get a lot more when you purchase gems etc.. All in all, I would recommend this game to pass your time.
US	5	2015-09-11	1.6.0	CodeSymphonia13	More Fun Than I Expected	I downloaded this app because I saw it being played on Roosterteeth's Game Kids channel and it looked pretty fun. That turned out to be an understatement S I have spent way too much time playing this game. It is a great app and the free to play aspect is always a good thing. The microtransactions don't take away from the experience as they only really serve as a way to accelerate gameplay and not alter it completely. I definitely recommend downloading this app.
US	5	2015-09-11	1.6.0	blam1	Fun game	Very fun!
US	4	2015-09-11	1.6.0	Edward Galligan III	Addicting	"Super fun game. Very addicting. Although, once you get up to higher levels, things start moving a lot slower because it's harder to get the money to be able to level up dragons and stuff. Sometimes it takes me over a week (checking in on the game maybe a couple of times a day) to get past one round. Stuff fun for the challenge of beating higher level dragons with lower level dragons though.

Also, has anyone had crashing issues lately? I deleted a bunch of stuff on my iPad, reset it, and still can't even open the game without it crashing. I even just tried deleting the app and re-downloading it. I hope an update comes out for this soon.

It seems as though others are having the same issues. I haven't played in like a week.

Crashing has been fixed for me, but now it's gotten to the point where it takes weeks to get passed one spot from how high the levels jump up."

US	5	2015-09-11		Chalenging game	AWESOME	This game is awesome I highly recommend it.
US	4	2015-09-11		Ani Lover 534	Awesome game	I love this game and all the dragons, battles and all but every time I try to update it doesn't complete the update.
US	5	2015-09-10	1.5.1	Dxin	Worst game ever!	I was playing dragon mania and then suddenly all my gems just disappeared in the middle of my fighting game and I had fifteen of them. I was trying to save up but I couldn't and gems are really hard to get. Also, the buyings are overpriced. It makes me cry. I am only nine so don't be mean to me. If you give me my gems back, I will be happier nd will give this game a better rating.
US	4	2015-09-07	1.5.1	Bigmane123	Just needs an update fix	"Don't get me wrong this is a good game. With some adjustment this game would probably be the best dragon game out right now. The only problem is that it's missing a few key adjustments to make the experience better. 

Pros: 
•High-Quality Animations
•Fun Battling System
•Cool Dragon Breeds
•Interesting Story Line

Cons:
•You have to move everything like a puzzle piece to move your objects. 
•The prices to remove obstacles on additional islands is ridiculous. (8k to move a tiny rock!)
•The contests they have are unfair. (2 minutes in, and theres already a guy with 1 million points)
•You can't cancel an egg if you're breeding a duplicate.
•Sometimes the servers are down and you lose your win streak in the division. (I was on an 18 win streak until I got disconnected)

With a few more adjustments this game has the potential to be a blockbuster hit like c.o.c"
US	5	2015-09-02	1.5.1	Recklessgun	Great game	My daughter turned me on to it and I have been hooked ever since. We like to see what dragon combinations we can come up with. However resources take for ever to accumulate. I have two boss dragons so that helps with the gold, but food is an every day struggle. Both my daughter and myself both like the dragons of the day and week. This game is worth a look.
US	4	2015-08-31	1.5.1	Ariana Johnson	I want more dragons!😫	"I am a bit annoyed that I can't quite continue this game if I can't breed anymore dragons. And if I can't breed anymore dragons then what is the point?! The reason why I can't breed anymore dragons is because I don't have anymore habitats, so I tried to buy more habitats but it tells me ""maximum number built"".... I have three lands. I had one at first but I bought two more to see if that would solve the problem but it didn't???"
US	4	2015-08-30	1.5.1	Thatweirdotakuchick	It's fun	It has many things to do and you can easily have something that is going on.
US	3	2015-08-28	1.5.1	MissChris6375	Suggestions for improvements	"If I deez nuts had known then what I know now....I would NOT download this game. It takes a lot of money to advance through the game. It takes a lot food to level up dragons; it takes real life money to buy gems; gems are necessary to large amounts of food; it's a giant circle.  

Worse, the claim is that you can advance in the game when you advance along the campaign trail. Well as soon as you level your dragons up the opposing dragons you face magically appear several levels higher! It's impossible to succeed without spending giant sums of money. 

I wish I'd never ever downloaded this game.  While it's a lot of fun, it's also a giant money trap. I have other games I enjoy equally that I don't spend 1/4 as much as I do in DML."
US	5	2015-08-27	1.5.1	Ethan36	Cool	This game is so awesome
US	4	2015-08-27	1.5.1	vampsfan	Love the game but can't connect	I have played this game for about a year now but since I got my new iPhone and iPad that app will take control to the internet. Please fix this it was my favorite game
US	3	2015-08-27	1.5.1	Jaeger79	Interesting idea / not the greatest execution	Just like many users have mentioned in their rating below.  This game has its ups and downs.  Positives include (dragon training, fighting, and breeding) Negatives (constant disconnects which really screw up your game play when your in a tournament or just wanting to play map levels.  Facebook will not connect or crashes the game when linking.  The developer has almost daily events coming up, problem being they have the goal set as something that anyone that just started or even 60+ days into the game cannot reach.  example farm the most food and post to the leaderboard, great idea except my medium level farms are only cranking out around 10,000 food every 12 hours.  The guys at the top of the leaderboard, yeah you guessed it they are in the millions.  Same thing with collecting gold, or breeding dragons.  So back to my original thought process, its interesting but needs some major fixes implemented if it wants to attract and keep some newer gamers.
US	5	2015-08-26	1.5.1	Morduath	Ms.	"The only reason I gave the game 4 stars is that feeding the dragons should be improved. Either it should not take so much food to level them up, or farms should be able to grow more food in each allotted time.   Or, perhaps, there could be a building where coins could be exchanged for food.

Other than the food issue, I love the game. The contests are fun. The dragons are adorable, and the battles are challenging!"
US	4	2015-08-25	1.5.1	jeannieinabottle	Dragon Mania Legends	I would put more time and money into this game if it didn't keep crashing.  Too often I'm in a battle and the connection gets lost and I've lost my progress.  It's upsetting because it forces you too by more hits to continue to achieve winning battles.  If that glitch was fixed I'd give it a higher rating.  The best part is that there are several options to get what you need without always having to continue to put $$$$ into it.
US	3	2015-08-25	1.5.1	Not Pro Gamer	Still a few problems...	In this app I have made good progress, but the game won't let me link my Facebook and randomly crashes when I try to go into the game. I have an iPod touch 4 and just have the right iOS to play, but I hate waiting a few days until I can get in the app when I have things ready to be farmed and eggs ready to hatch. I have seen others have that same problem as me, so please have this as the top priority to fix. Also, I would like the Facebook glitch to be fixed as well. I've tried everything from the customer help page but none of it helped. I look forward for the game to be fixed!
US	3	2015-08-24	1.5.0	Amyann0929	Love BUT PLEASE FIX	"I love this game but have some issues.  When a try to train my dragon it takes my stuff and doesn't work. I also get through a bunch of winning streaks and for some reason I get kicked out and lose all the progress I have made. I do not have a weak connection at all. Other then that I love the game and still go back to play it.

Update... I'm back again because I spent money on a special and now it just keeps throwing me out of the game! Please fix Ty the issue"
US	4	2015-08-21	1.5.0	aly bobba	Almost 5 stars.	I love the game and would of given it 5 stars except for 2 things. Crashes to often and sometimes right in the middle of battles especially when I have used my gems to use the boost. I don't get my gems back and even if I am winning I haven't won when I open game back up. Second I have an I Pad and I can't be friends with the people I know that have Windows products. Hopefully these 2 things will change. If not I'll still play because it is a lot of fun.
US	4	2015-08-21	1.5.0	Nb01db04	Love the game!	Look I love the game a lot actually but the thing is that you can't get any new types even if you wanted it until you really high level.  Doing for the new update come out the new elements were dark and light. They should Lee's give you a chance to get a table driving with at least those two elements in it I've been waiting for for a long time and I really want them we have to be 35 or higher to get either one which I think is probably one of the stupidest things here I definitely think that it's an awesome game and also you can get the void and the dragon just bugging a bronze medal in the fighting tournament all I'm saying is you should of the Billy to get a type you want but maybe on the type of dragon you want. I'm saying is make it so we can at least get the type you want in a dragon doesn't matter what Dragon just the type. But I definitely recommend that you start off with a lot of gems and you can get dragons either way awesome dragons!
US	5	2015-08-20	1.5.0	Game disser🎮😒	Not bad😏	This game is really fun even tho I've only had it for a few days. I think that the graphics in this game are way better that any other dragon game, and I've had all the other ones. And I deleted them right away cuz it wasn't what I was looking for. But when I tried this game, I fell in love. I defiantly think this game is great for every one and  is not to scary for young children. If ur looking for a dragon game, choose this one!
US	3	2015-08-20	1.5.0	I am Camicus	Light/Shadow elements ruined game	The new addition of the light/shadow elements has now severely decreased the advantage of having any other element-based dragon. This is because the light/shadow attacks each have three elements they are strong against with none they are weak against while all the older elements only have one element they are strong against and some have two elements they are weak against. This puts a huge disadvantage on all other elements. All our time, gold, and food spent on improving the old Dragons was in vain now that the two new elements clearly have triple the battle advantage. Not sure if I'm going to continue playing this game after such a discouraging blow to our past effort improving now disadvantaged dragons.
US	4	2015-08-19	1.5.0	willreviewforcurrency	Great game	"Fun game, beautiful graphics. Better than the other dragon games I've played. I really appreciate that the PvP does not allow opponents to steal your food or gold (so far). Instead, it ranks you by points, and players with the top scores win various prizes. I hope they keep the PvP system this way.

One complaint about this game is the breeding. I understand there must be wait times, but I think 6 hours for a common dragon is far too much. I would expect that for an uncommon, but not a common. Also, breeding epics and legendaries is especially difficult. It is near impossible to breed the dragon of the week, and sometimes month, for this reason.

Overall, great game, highly recommended."
US	4	2015-08-18	1.5.0	kschill83	Love it! But..	I love this game and have been playing it for months. Those that complain about how expensive everything is needs to stop. I never use real money in this gam and easily saved up the millions for al the islands. My complaint right now is now my game keeps crashing after it almost finished loading... So I haven't played in a few days. Little upset abut this and hope they can fix this issue since I love the game and would prefer not to delete it.
US	3	2015-08-18	1.5.0	Rukrisj	Crashes	I have played this game for months (and spent quite a bit in actual money via in-app purchases). I absolutely loved the game, but now it has crashed and I cannot find *anything* to help. I even deleted the app (even though I had to risk losing *everything*) and even after downloading it again, it is STILL crashing at the loading screen. I am not pleased with this at all considering the time and money I have put into months of this game.
US	4	2015-08-18	1.5.0	Duchessmoon	App keeps crashing suddenly	"I've not gotten many games but I enjoy this one, however since the last update, the app keeps crashing! I don't want to delete it for fear of losing my progress, but it's frustrating to not be able to get on.  
Like another person wrote about the breeding... You follow what is in the task list and you try different combinations but you still don't get the breed you are trying for!"
US	3	2015-08-18	1.5.0	RegretTheFuture	Won't open!?	I used to love this game I really did, but since this morning every time I go to open the app it loads like it normally does and then it exits out of the app and returns to my normal home screen. Reading through other reviews I've noticed that this has started to happen to others earlier today as well.. I hope that this is not permanent as I do really enjoy playing this game on my free time.
US	4	2015-08-18	1.5.0	TazDragonMaster21	Help	I don't know if this is a bug or glitch but could you please fix this? I tried reinstalling the app and deleting it, resetting and shutting off my device and it still doesn't work. It opens and loads but when its about to display my island, it just sends me back to the home screen. Any way you can fix this? I love the game though! Don't get me wrong it's great but could you fix this issue?
US	3	2015-08-18	1.5.0	Jezzy14$	Game issues	Normally I'd give a higher rating because I like the game but for almost an entire day the new version isnt working. It shuts down the app b4 the game can start. Thought it was me - but I deleted it and re-added from the app store and it does the same thing. If it were a couple hours - it wouldnt have affected the star rating.  But an entire day???? All my other apps so when will it be fixed???
US	4	2015-08-18	1.5.0	Rainbow Wolf 2501	Love it but frustrated...	I absolutely adore the game but ever since the update came out my game crashes and doesn't even let me load it anymore. I'm not sure if it's a problem on my part or something from the update is causing it to crash. No matter what I still love the game but am pretty upset I can play it. I hope something is fixed in it or one day my phone lets me load it again cause I was addicted to it!!
US	3	2015-08-18	1.5.0	Smandarine	Crashing problem	I have been playing this game for a while now, and I love it. I love all of the dragons and the breeding. But all of a sudden the app starts crashing. I have an iPad mini, and I have tried everything. I have tried closing the app, hard resetting my iPad, wifi connection, etc, and nothing has helped. I'm not entirely sure if it has to do with the new update or not, but I'm not going to delete the app, and risk loosing everything. I would like some bug fixes.
US	5	2015-08-18	1.5.0	boss5224	App crashes everytime	I tried opening the app a couple hours ago but it crashes and after that it won't even open the app anymore, I keep rebooting my device, reinstalling the app, and even restoring my device from new, but it still crashes! Please fix this!

US	4	2015-08-17	1.5.0	TheDragonPerson	Great game, but...	This is a awesome game, don't get me wrong. It's just that today the game is crashing every time it starts up. I can't even get past the loading screen, making the game impossible to play. Please fix this bug :c
US	2	2015-08-17	1.5.0	Magpie926	Use to be good...	Since the new update the game won't even open. It crashes before it ever loads. Use to be a really fun game and now I can't play it.
US	3	2015-08-17	1.5.0	MauraJP17	Love it....If it will open again	I really like this game. But every time I try to open it I get the loading screen and then shuts down. It's been like this since the new update. I have tried to restart my phone but it still won't work. I like this game a lot, but I was wondering if I should just delete it because now it's only taking up memory space.
US	5	2015-08-17	1.5.0	Shadybrat	Having issues	I'm currently having issues with opening the app. It fully loads, and then it kicks me off like I have a bad connection but I've been in the same area I've been at for 2 weeks. Maybe it's a glitch or maintenance but other than that one small issue its a really good game with so many types of dragons. I really love it, but would love it even better if I could play it soon.
US	4	2015-08-17	1.5.0	Madperson12	Love/hate	Great game, huge fan. Recently started crashing when trying to open the game tho.
US	4	2015-08-17	1.5.0	The pending request glitch	I love the game, but there is a bug where I can't play it.	I've been playing the game for 2 months and really enjoying it.  But then, I woke up one morning and the game crashed whenever it finished loading.  I tried everything to get it to work, but I couldn't get it to work, it crashed every time.  Could you please fix this glitch or I will start having withdrawals.  Lol...
US	5	2015-08-17	1.5.0	Clyclone Isaac	Satisfied, but	When I look at dragons sometimes (especially the new ones) there pixelated and I mainly breed dragons to admire them. Plz fix this bug. Btw this game has been taken to a whole new level. Makes me love it more. Thanks for adding new things. Really appreciate it.

US	5	2015-08-16	1.5.0	Banana man88	Love it!	I love the game! Been playing it for a while and now I have a perfectly timed update, only ONE minor problem. The small dragon profiles, like when you go to explore ruins or select for battle, the faces become a more pixelated version. 9/10 times it will, but occasionally it won't. Is it supposed to be pixelated or???
US	5	2015-08-16	1.5.0	Nikname taken 2	Dragon Awesomeness!!!	This game has been a real blast for me! I totally Love DML! It's a totally addictive game. only thing I don't like are the in game purchases. I do however enjoy the game so much, I a lot myself a monthly budget to spend on the game though. It's worth it to me. I love my babies. There are definitely advantages to putting a little cash into it. I am a true dragon lover, and totally recommend this game to all who love them just as much. Enjoy and have fun.

US	3	2015-08-15	1.5.0	Jaymoney810	To much pay to play	I love this game love the dragons but everything is way to expensive. Over 100 dollars for a dragon. That's crazy!!!!!
US	5	2015-08-14	1.5.0	Stealthninja76	Awesome	This is one of the best games I have played on my phone, it's really addictive and is fun for everyone highly recommended
US	2	2015-08-14	1.5.0	Awesome dragon657	Why?	I don't like how some dragons have the same animation of other dragons( a lot actually) like how the smoke dragon has the same animation of the fire dragon and more so pls make a update on how each dragon has its own animation. P.s also make the dragons look different not just added body parts.
US	3	2015-08-14	1.5.0	Stevedastud	It's a good game	The only thing I don't like about it is how long it takes to get gems without micro transactions, but that's what all the games are like these days. Other than that it's pretty fun, and cheesy
US	3	2015-08-14	1.5.0	Exciting :) :)	Love it but....	"I love the game but I don't like the fact that I have keep downloading contents can we please get that fixed I'm tired of re-downloading everything just to play with the dragons and to play a battling game or downloading the game in general it should already be downloaded as soon as we click on the game to play please correct it please. 
Thank you"
US	5	2015-08-14	1.5.0	PhantomH3ro	My review	This game was really fun. I like how it had a clash of clans feel to it when you get to construct all these buildings. And I like the idea of raising you dragons.

US	3	2015-08-14	1.5.0	Minanee	Fun but limiting	The game is fun but after a while it is clear you need a bunch of friends- but the game isn't interactive enough with those friends for it to be worth it for them.

US	5	2015-08-13	1.5.0	Mekenna1227	Dragon mania legends review	This game is really fun but I do think that there should be a easier way of getting food it's very hard when u get farther in the game...but other than that this game is really fun!!
US	4	2015-08-13	1.5.0	Zach<>Madison	Legendary Dragons?	Now. We all know this is an awesome game but the legendary dragons just cost WAY TOO MUCH! Like I understand that they are the best in the game but they don't have to be $100 American dollars I mean it's a game. So please understand that that is like 3k or almost 4k gems and IT WOULD MAKE WAY MORE SENSE TO HAVE LEGENDARY DRAGONS AT 1k gems.

US	3	2015-08-13	1.5.0	Foxunicorncatkite	Eh.	The battle arena kinda stuck because it doesn't give you an easy medium and hard option every time. They already have different point levels. I don't understand that and it's VERY VERY VERY ANNOYING! But I love the game.
US	5	2015-08-13	1.5.0	Jaden 112673	Better than monster legends	I really love this game better then monster legends I recommend you getting. It
US	4	2015-08-13	1.5.0	Yeauhahahahaha	I love it	Amazing game only wish you can name dragons. Maybe have something so you can pick your favorite team for battles. N to play the game with no wifi. Then this game will be perfect...

US	5	2015-08-13	1.5.0	Schnazberry	Amazing!	This game is beautiful and addicting at the same time. I LOVE the new update! The dragon designs are epic. One thing I would like to add is a feature that lets you name your dragon. Besides that, I love this game!
US	1	2015-08-13	1.5.0	Sifhsochajxbajxjs	Update Problem	I downloaded the new update and now the app doesn't even open. I read that I need to uninstall and reinstall the game, but then I would lose all of my data. I've been playing for almost two months, so I don't want to do that. How should I fix this?
US	5	2015-08-13	1.5.0	3mail 1234124321	Dragon mania legends	This is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!😃
US	4	2015-08-13	1.5.0	#Icy G#	AMAZING GAME but...	I love this game but waiting times are wayyy too long. I love everything else about the game though. I highly recommend it to any dragon lover.
US	5	2015-08-13	1.5.0	Dem0n1c Her0	Please put a $20 VIP year membership	I think if you do that people would play a lot more and also if you can please enhance the breeding for good dragon by a couple more % and also I really love this game so please continue put cooler and nicer things on as you go and never give up on this game and another thing look into making a part 2 of this game that would be amazing
US	4	2015-08-13	1.5.0	APRyoki	Good	"I thought that I'd never want to play one of these games.
But I'm kind of hooked on it.
The artwork is amazing and the amount of dragons in it is quite high up there to where it seems you'll never run out, which is a plus.
It is a good game, aside from having a huge jump on the leveling aspect(levels 10+ is absurdly high to reach). 
There is a lot to do, from exploring for relics, pvp, main quest, breeding dragons(nice), and farming for food. 
Overall, I didn't give it 5 stars because at those high levels(10+) leveling up without paying real money becomes such a grind that it almost seems tedious. If there wasn't any other ways to enjoy the game, it would receive lower stars"
US	5	2015-08-13	1.5.0	Almi27	Still love the game =] (review 3>	"The new update is sick!!! Love the 2 new elements 😍💪🏽 I have so much to do!!! So little time and gold hahaha I'm excited ☺️😃😍

Older post:

I don't like that mines keep getting captured. I thought after a while of fighting for them and getting them back you get to keep them. I have one that I can't even get back anymore unless I level up my dragons which involves other stuff. Sort of annoying but what can ya do. I also dislike the adds but, I know those generate revenue so they're a good thing overall. 

From previous review:
Graphics are nice, speed is great, awesome features and, baby dragons are sooooo cute!!!!"
US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	luboost	Not just for kids	There are a lot of things to do in this game to maintain interest (many different battles, quests, and of course collecting and perfecting dragons).  Gameloft is also very active in updating the game, so it keeps getting better.
US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	Scipio33	Good game	Nice effort, really enjoy the game. 😄
US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	Dinoman8	Awesome Dragons	This game is awesome I would love to see what else you can do with the types of dragons and how far you can take this game I play it everyday it is one of my favorite games. Plz more updates and more interesting types of dragons.one of my favorite dragons is the Light Dragon and the Shadow Dragon is not far behind.it would be awesome to see an emerald Dragon in this game.
US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	Audreydoodles😛	Best game ever	This game is amazing I have had it for a long time and I still he fun with it. You can raise dragons to fight, and do much more it's just a wonderful game....
US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	Blu642	I ❤️ The New Update!!!!	The update is awesome, it's goes great with the new skills like the light and dark elements, and new awesome/amazing dragons!! This is a Awesome Game I ever played!!!
US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	Thumb Tacks	Yep it's Great!	I love this game. The dragons are creative, the breeding is challenging and the fighting is exciting. I just wish you can move around the trees and other decorations on a new island instead of paying to remove an obstacle. Some of those obstacles I like and don't want to get rid of it just move it.
US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	Loch Ness Cho'Gath	Amazing!	I think this game is Amazing! It way be annoying to wait all the time for more XP, gold, and dragon's, but its worth the wait!
US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	Moky boy 1000	Best game ever	I love it so much and it is the best game ever I played

US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	Dj Mario D	Best game ever	"I am addicted to this game.
I love how the dragons are adorable. I just think it should take less food to feed a dragon. And also to add another nest it cost a lot of diamonds, but overall this is a amazing game. 😊"
US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	Kay112399	Update	"I really like the new elements and the idea behind the dragon book.

However I think you should be able to refine you searches in the dragon book more. I mean I was looking for a specific dragon and it was hard to find. 
Also why change what works I enjoyed the simple arrows pointing at things telling me which elements were weak to what. Now it's just confusing with the weak attack strong attack. Can we go back to that? Or if you have to list it could you maybe put weak to and strong against please and and you. 

If you are considering downloading this app I strongly suggest you should"
US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	Charles.skym	Great game	This game is great.  For those who don't understand this type of game you have two options later in the game.  First and most common is play it once or twice a day genre...Or, find a sugar mamma/daddy to buy real life currency purchases. I have played for a month straight along with several other games to maximize downtime.
US	5	2015-08-12	1.5.0	Ahdkdj (not real nickname)	Coolio!	I love this app I like that it's challenging strategically but not to the point that you get cheated. As long as you're smart about your decisions it's really fun! Also I love that you can fight to get rewards and it's not TOO hard. I'd only suggest that the game wouldn't always require WiFi. It'd be nice to check up on things and only need WiFi for the Arena and things like that.
US	5	2015-08-11	1.4.1	Lycan2783	Great game!!!!	Love the game so far, still figuring some things out on it. But I love the game!!!
US	5	2015-08-11	1.4.1	Tobyguilmon	Great game!!	I love this game b/c its 3D Dragons and nice designs. I hope there will be guilds and new dragons!? Can't wait!!. It's like dragon city. Both are great!!

US	5	2015-08-10	1.4.1	Scarletblue7	Love this game!😍	This game is sooooo fun. I'm addicted already! It's so fun, when you get to battle the dragon. And breeding and leveling the dragons just adds to the fun! I could play this game for hours of I could!😉 great game, and so simple to use. Set up great and had no trouble at all grasping the concept and rules. Definately recommend it!

US	4	2015-08-10	1.4.1	Ksecoco	Fun and enjoyable game, but a few problems	It's a fun game to play, I've had a lot of fun and the graphics are great. I have had quite a few problems with it, like it not being able to download 0.0 MB of data.  Everything also costs way too much, as if it is trying to force you to spend money. I would suggest looking at dragonvale's currency system, that way is so much more fair.

US	5	2015-08-05	1.4.1	The_BadWolf	AMAZING APP!!! 😛	"This is an AMAZING app! I love it sooooo much! But.. There's some changes that I really, really think y'all need to change. First of all, breeding time is SOOOO long. Shortening it a bit would be very nice. ☺️   Second of all, as you level up your dragons, it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to feed them! It requires just so much food! Lower that would make this game much better. Also.. I think mini-games for the dragons would be wonderful!! Not just the ""training"", but more fun games for them to play!!!! Thank y'all so much for making this game!!!!  😛"
US	2	2015-08-05	1.4.1	CatZelda	Some problems	The app is a fun one, that I won't deny. However, I frequently have difficulty connecting, after which I'm sometimes forced to redownload content I already have in order to view some of my dragons. I find this extremely irritating. I also think it's silly to hold these contests in which the person who feeds the most/spends the most etc. wins something no one else gets. It's obviously going to go to a wealthy individual with money to burn or someone who's saved up for one of these events.
US	5	2015-08-05	1.4.1	PhoenixXx71	Great game! Great Support Team!	Intending to only play for the sake of my 17 year old, I quickly got hooked! It's the first game that's come along to make me take a break from Clash of Clans in over 2 years! I also can't say enough about the support team. You guys rock! You really care about a player's enjoyment of the game, and you take action when technical difficulties arise. Many, many thanks!
US	5	2015-08-05	1.4.1	Boo boo 2000	AMAZING DRAGON GAME!😍😍😍	I was looking for a good dragon game and this is the one i found and was NOT disappointed. This game is addicting and fun and the only thing I thought was annoying was the wait for the dragons to breed. I was breeding my dragons and I had to wait half an hour just for them to breed which I thought was a little reduculous, but oh well, because this game is still awesome!!!!!!
US	5	2015-07-30	1.4.1	Isaiah stennis	Cool game	My opinion this is best trainer pet game I've played.
US	4	2015-07-30	1.4.1	LunatheFox122 :)	Great game, but a couple issues	"The game is amazing and addicting, I have played for a couple weeks now. However....

1. I want to upgrade my hatchery to lv.2 and it takes 150 gems to do so! There is NO option to use gold. There should be an option to upgrade the hatchery with gold, like any other upgrade. 
2. Also, breeding and hatching take too much time. You can't even sell the egg if you know it's a dragon you don't wish to keep. It's an unneeded   waste of time waiting. There should be an option to sell the egg."
US	5	2015-07-30	1.4.1	OxMom	I love this game	Completely addicting, I play it all the time. I love my dragons and although I hate fighting games, the quests are fun. Best is that my 6 year old son plays as well so we talk about our dragons, send each other gifts and help each other complete quests, which I prefer so much more than fighting each other. Only wish we could share unwanted dragons with friends rather than sell them off.

US	4	2015-07-28	1.4.1	CheyEllio	Good, but...	Let me start with, I really like the game. It's simple, it's fun, and you get special items just for playing a little every day. The thing I do not like is feeling the constant pressure of having to put real money in the game to achieve a goal :/ It feels as if you can only go so far without paying for something. I like the option of being able to purchase something to get it faster, but to feel like I have to just to get to the next step isn't fair.
US	5	2015-07-27	1.4.1	Hkkknknbknc	Zjfodihdhjk	I like monster mania legends because I think the battling is pretty fun and,I like the graphics. But my favorite part is raising and breeding the monsters.

US	3	2015-07-27	1.4.1	Otawo	Not too bad	This is not a great game. It suffers from a flawed game model that a lot of F2P mobile games share. You almost can't progress without spending real money on the fake money for the game. Its the flaw that will make sure that console gaming never dies.

US	5	2015-07-27	1.4.1	Mombette	Yvette	I love this game. Very addicting and one of those games that you can relax to! The only drawback is the food. Not enough when trying to rank the dragons up.

US	5	2015-07-26	1.4.1	Dragons905	So Fun	It's so fun!In the beginning though I would have liked to be able to choose what type of dragon I wanted and what to call a dragon.It would have been more fun if you could choose the name of your dragons after they hatch.you could also shorten the times it takes for breeding or hatching but It's still a great game non the less!!!
US	5	2015-07-26	1.4.1	Phantom turtles	Need stuff	It is very cool but there should be like less lag and more likely to get gems but other than that is very fun

US	1	2015-07-23	1.4.1	69Tony69Yayo69	Play Something Else	Too many glitches and bugs when new updates are released. Too restrictive and very unbalanced. If your game is restarted from the beginning due to their fault, they will not help you to recover lost game data.

US	1	2015-07-23	1.4.1	♥Hate	BEWARE-- steals your money & time.	I enjoyed playing this game & even spent money on various  in-app purchases. This game makes it difficult to enjoy without actually spending real money to advance through the game. I had made to to level 32, and had advanced level dragons which took time & money. I opened up my app as usual one day & all my progress was reset back to level one & the money spent on gems/food/dragons were all gone. No response from the developers despite 3 emails. I do not recommend this game unless you like to be robbed!!

US	1	2015-07-22	1.4.1	pxkkjkjrk	Ridiculous	I was at level 24 and just got on the app to check all my dragons. Somehow everything was erased and it put me back to level 1. I was just on the app about an hour ago. I didn't update anything or delete it so I don't know what happened but I won't be downloading it again.

Have fun!!!"
US	5	2015-07-22	1.4.1	IAMMEEP	it's awesome but one thing is,	I love the game but they need to raise the gem amounts when you want to buy gems like not the money but the gems to raise them because when you are trying to get a 3000 gem dragon you can't get it because you don have enough gems you buy the highest amount you STILL can't get it

US	5	2015-07-20	1.4.1	Zem22345	Patience	"This game has immediately become my favorite iphone game. I love breeding the different dragon types and the combat system is easy and doesn't take too much thought.

What people don't seem to understand is that these games are free to play, so the developers have to make money somehow. Which means unless you have tons of extra money there isn't an iphone game out there that you will be able to play nonstop. Making us wait for things to happen in the game taxes our patience and is the best way to make up spend real money, so in order to enjoy this game—and all the other free to play games—simply change your expectations. And if you want a game to play nonstop, buy a computer or console game."

US	2	2015-07-17	1.4.1	Pandapaws53366	Technical Issues😕	The first time, I downloaded this game on my kindle fire. It was an awesome game, and when I got around level 30, it erased all my data in the game. Then, I downloaded the game on my iPod. It was great until it kept telling me I needed more data space even though I still had 2.1 gigabytes left. So, now I can't do anything on it anymore.
US	5	2015-07-17	1.4.1	Megsrule	Dragons!	This is a really fun game. I love dragons!
US	4	2015-07-17	1.4.1	WolfSpirit007	Great	Really fun and easy, but I wish some of the rare dragons were easier to get/earn
US	5	2015-07-16	1.4.1	XxxShardanay	Best game ever	At first I would get bored after awhile but I've been playing for a solid 2 months and there is so much you can do never gets old love it
US	2	2015-07-16	1.4.1	Alibi I	Not that good anymore	First I logged into Facebook and I never got my prairie or the gems. Then gems are way too hard to get without making your parents bankrupt. At least rise of berk (how to train your dragon) has quests you can earn premium currency upon completion. The collections in the dragon codex are almost impossible. I haven't completed a collection since February which was 1 month after I got the game. This ties into the fact that breeding takes forever and just getting a cloud dragon took me 2 months, so imagine trying to breed a toxic dragon. Legendary dragons are so hard to get without paying several hundred dollars in gems to buy the thing. I wait forever and must have about 1500 other apps to keep me entertained (YouTube is fantastic about killing boredom while waiting for food for 5 long, useless hours!?!) Between food, new islands,and food, I have almost no coins at all. The fountain of youth is a big sign that you app producers are still messing things up. It takes months, MONTHS to gather 15 gems to babyify a dragon, even then I must wait 12 ridiculous hours to get my baby dragon. I don't see the point of the fountain of youth. My dragon gets no buffs.It should at least produce extra coins. We pay 15 hard-to-earn gems for the biggest rip-off I've ever seen (even bigger than the first flight seen in big hero 6 which was stolen from how to train your dragon hiccup and toothless first flight seen). The next problem is WAITING. The wait times are insane ,battle energy recharge and arena recharge they take so long I will grow old waiting to battle Vikings or my friends again. Competitions and dragon of the week/month are so hard to get I might die. Last issue you did give everyone some of the missing puzzle pieces back but I am still missing 6. Those took me six days to get and I am mad. Btw WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WHOULD PAY 35 GEMS AKA $50 FOR A MYSTERY PUZZLE PIECE?!? I'll tell you ONLY A BILLIONAIRE WOULD! And last time I checked most people are not billionaires!! This is one of my favorite games so pleeezzze fix it
US	5	2015-07-16	1.4.1	Fvkn.Ryu	Love this game	I love this game but I can't get on it now I don't know why?

US	5	2015-07-16	1.4.1	Jawz333	Best game	You need more dragons : )
US	5	2015-07-16	1.4.1	Ositawinnie	Good but one slight thing	I love this game a lot but I have one concern. I wish I could change the names of the dragons cuz some names are Aruk or Lump. Plz do fix that and I will be happy.I also want in the dungeons to be able to not have the stamina to be gone once it's used because my dragons for battle are my best dragons to use......and once they are done with stamina...its over. I find the dungeons useless to me in that way.

US	1	2015-07-13	1.4.1	Midgeireland	Too costly to play	This game tops my list at being the most expensive to play IF you want to advance. People will play for a short time then walk away because it's not fun when you can't advance. Also I lost my puzzle pieces and do not receive achievement points on a daily basis. The wait times are ridiculous, rewards not applied and most of all I was unable to get the patriotic dragon. Of all things that one should have been at least easy to buy. Short version - don't waste your time on this game.
US	5	2015-07-13	1.4.1	Mr. Philgood	Awesome	This game rocks

US	5	2015-07-12	1.4.1	Ash_cook	REFERRAL CODE	b59f8 PLEASE USE THIS
US	1	2015-07-12	1.4.1	DoerreFreak	Almost Forced In-App Purchases Cost WAY Too Much	"It's so sad, because this game is amazing! A purchase can cost someone up to $100??? Really!? Who in their right mind would pay for that? If you make your purchases more humane, you'd make even MORE money. Sadly, you get to enjoy this game and spend money on it until there's just NO WAY to keep playing because they make it impossible without spending ludicrous amounts of money. I wish games cost 3 dollars outright again. I was fine with waiting and being patient, but I've come to the point in the game where I can't do anything without waiting 2+ days to even feed my dragon ONCE. 

Edit: I'm going from 3 to 1 star now. Any flicker in wifi and you lose quite a bit of progress. Besides that, it is still impossible to feed dragons the ludicrous amounts of food they need. The competitions are leveled poorly. Dragons on your level and depending on type should be considered NORMAL. Obviously dragons WAY above your level should be hard! Come on."
US	5	2015-07-11	1.4.1	Brookegoth	Mlp	This s good game
US	5	2015-07-11	1.4.1	It's cool bro	Good but.......	The gems prices are crazy like bad it costs 100$ to get like 3000 gems it's crazy you can't even buy some dragons that are legendary if you buy the island full of gems just good game bad prices
US	1	2015-07-11	1.4.1	Awessdejhvsbznfnxb	Fail	"Recommendations for new update:

Remove the ability to use vip accounts on non-vip events.

DO NOT increase the amount of vip events.

DO NOT end the dungeon event on the campaign map.

Increase the chance of breeding rare/epic/legendary dragons. 

Allow for breeding dragon outside the ""limited time breeding"" event.

I really like this game but it is flawed and biased.

Continue to have upgrades and habitat increases beyond the level 40.

Have the fountain of youth cost gold instead of gemstones."
US	3	2015-07-11	1.4.1	The AnonDrone	Fun Game!	"I thought it was a fun concept to breed and fight dragons. Brought me back to the time when I played Pokemon. Unfortunately, there are a few things that set you back when you play.

The pacing is ridiculously slow. You can only fight on the campaign map 3 times before there's a cooldown timer. You have to wait for your dragons to breed. You have to wait for your dragons to HATCH. You have to wait until you level (slowly) until you can get more dragons, but then you gotta wait AGAIN for everything else! From this, it's pretty clear you gotta wait. But all this waiting is only to encourage you to use real money to buy Gems.

There's also no way to add friends in-game. In fact, there really ISN'T a way to add friends, as far as I can tell. Most of the features require you to add friends, but it's so convoluted, you have to end up soloing to get anything done!

Other than that, it's a cute game, but after all the waiting you gotta do, it's all up to if you have the patience."
US	5	2015-07-11	1.4.1	starpie796@ gmail.com	THIS GAME IS AWESOME, but...	Ok, I just wanted to say that this is one of the Greatest apps ever, but the one downside to this is that U CANT RENAME UR FRIGGN DRAGONS!!!!!!! CMON CREATORS!! IF U WANT A TAKE-CARE-OF-UR-OWN-DRAGON GAME, AT LEAST LET PEOPLE RENAME THEIR DRAGONS!!!!!!! WE NEED A UPDATE THAT LETS U NAME YOUR OWN DRAGONS!!!!!! THATS THE MAIN PROBLEM HERE!!!!! FIX IT NOW!!!!!

You Guys Should Have A Dark And Light Element Dragons And Maybe A Legendary Type And If You Breed A Legendary (1 Elemented Dragon) Dragon With A Common (Fire,Wind,Power,Water) It Will Make It The Ultimate Form,These Are Just My Intentions. Also You Guys Should Really Have A Rename Dragon Option, I Forgot Add A Ice Type And God Type Dragon. thanks Grrrdth A** Game

US	1	2015-07-09	1.4.1	WolfVlyde	Terrible	It is such a terrible game and needs many improvements. It is very frustrating and glitchy. It is a very bad game so GameLoft just take it off the App Store/Google Play to save many people from suffering
US	3	2015-07-09	1.4.1	CrimsonSparkleMagic	Needs an Update	I was so looking forward to playing this game but now I'm starting to lose interest. I cannot proceed after beating a boss, the game keeps saying that I have lost connection. So I am wasting all my energies to keep battling the dragon without any process. This game needs an update to fix the bugs.

My only friends on Facebook are family members which would never play video games so I only have 2 friends (Toby and Someone else). So please make a smaller update first.
US	3	2015-07-09	1.4.1	Starky0117	Full	The game is cool and all but for some reason Its says I have the maximum amount of all habitats and I don't even have most of them? I can't hatch my first plant dragon because I supposedly have 12/12 habitats when I have none

""No network connection check your internet connection"" ok so I go check my internet it says I have internet. And then when I do it again it deletes everything I got! Someone should really fix this"
US	5	2015-07-08	1.4.1	Dragonbabby	My Favorite Game!	I am very picky about the games I play, but this has to be one of my favorite apps. I love the way it's set up, I love the quests, the battles are easy to understand and has somewhat of a challenge on occasion, but I love it. I love the variety of dragons. The animation it fantastic. I've never had to use real money to pay for anything in the game. It's a great game and I would recommend downloading it! :)
US	4	2015-07-08	1.4.1	Buster831	It's fun	I think this is a fun game. Dragons are my favorite mystical animal so, I like it.
US	4	2015-07-08	1.4.1	Cinder B.	Good game	Love this game. One thing that can be frustrating is ads pop up instantly and I almost always end up accidentally clicking them and going to a whole separate page. Another thing is even though I have millions of gold, I never seem to have enough food to level up my dragons. When breeding, the egg has to go to the hatchery and you can end up waiting hours or days for it to hatch even if it's a dragon you know you don't need. Would be nice to have another option there. All in all, a really fun game though.
US	5	2015-07-07	1.4.1	Forked89	<3	Loving this game :) Really addictive. Have it on the computer as well.

US	5	2015-07-07	1.4.1	Chihuahua33	One of the best, but...	"This game is one of the best dragon games I have ever played, but there are a few minor issues.
1: We can't rename our lovable little dragons.
2: The islands are way too expensive.
3: The limited time events are impossible to complete.
4: The food takes too long to grow, the more you need.
If these minor issues could be fixed, even if only a few of them, this would be the best game I've ever played.
Oops, one last thing. It would be great if you could visit players and invite them to be friends, even if they don't have facebook."

US	2	2015-07-07	1.4.1	(O)scar	Tone it down!	To level dragons you have to be bill gates son. As dragons grow levels, missions grow exponentially in difficulty. To feed them is no longer fun. Breeding used to give me exotics but now I hardly get any. There is literally a point where most players cannot continue. Leveling dragons is a very challenging feat. And the missions to get a scroll now are impossible. Same with the mines.

Srsly guys?!?!?
And also why does everything cost so much?!?!
I play the game and I start with like 5,000 coins, next thing I know it's costing me 300,000 coins just to get another island to take care of! Guys, the app is cute, I would love for my siblings to play this, but srsly? We, kids, do not have money like that to buy what we need. 
I play one of your other games( the mylittlepony one) and I quit it after a week or two becuz I needed all this money. But then u added in some stuff that now I play the game whenever I get the chance. 
I would like to be the same with this. So until then...3 ⭐️"

US	3	2015-07-06	1.4.1	Countryrose#7	Awesome game but a seriously annoying glitch	This game is great, but sometimes when I am battling, it exits me out and loads the game, taking my portal energies down the drain. And another thing. You need way too many gems for any action. I play a few other games like this that only require one gem per HOUR. That would be simply amazing, considering there is breeding times and hatching times that take over a day.

US	5	2015-07-05	1.4.1	Chullix	Amazing dragons!	This game is fantastic! I am very satisfied and also they have a unique name for each variety of dragons.
US	3	2015-07-05	1.4.1	Ninjadragon4424	Good game	Dragon Mania Legends is a good game because you can pet your dragons and I also don't like it because you can not change your dragons names.
US	3	2015-07-05	1.4.1	Jgj1835	Good game but....	It's a great game, keeps my son busy. However I think that there should be more ways to earn $ & gems. It will take you a long time to advance without using real $.
US	4	2015-07-05	1.4.1	.M1068	Great but	Okay so I've been playing this game a lot and lately I've noticed that all of the tournament levels are hard and those battle are impossible to win. I've spent at least 45 gems are refreshing it but everytime I refresh it the levels are the same, 'hard'. Please so something Bc that was the main way for me to win scrolls and now I can't.
US	5	2015-07-05	1.4.1	Smitty8384	Very good	Love this game!
US	5	2015-07-05	1.4.1	Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmggggggg	I love this game!	This game is the best!! I love it!! I play it everyday thank you so much for creating this game!!!:)
US	4	2015-07-05	1.4.1	Mayito503	Awesome game!	Really good game, I love it! The only thing that I don't really like its the time it takes to harvest food, and also the food intake when dragons have a higher level. It takes a long time to harvest  and a long time to in level up the dragons.
US	3	2015-07-05	1.4.1	:'3 :'3	I love it, but it could really use some changes.	I love this game I really do, but it needs some changes cuss it's just not fun anymore, instead of it being fun it's becoming a lot of work.. Like really ? Feeding your dragons is basically impossible since it needs so much food every level it grows, it's ridiculous, it really is. Not to mention the time is consumes to grow the food, the higher the lever the more food & money you need. The events ? Every time they get longer, more time consuming & you have to usually use gems which not everybody haves. The gems are super expensive & you don't get the amount you should for the price. There is a dragon that is more expensive than the package it self ! (narwhale) if you would want to buy it you couldn't cuss not even with a $100 dollars is enough ! Kids also play this game, they don't have 50, or 100 dollars to pay for gems. & not only that they have freaking tax ! It's not 50 flat ! It used to be fun in the beginning, but now ? It's just hard work.. It really just need some changes, before everybody just stops playing it. One last thing? We should be able to gift what ever we want, like dragons, habitats, gems, decoration, & we should be able to add all the neighbors we want from the game, not only by Facebook. Hope the updates get better 😁🙏🏻
US	5	2015-07-04	1.4.1	Isabella Maloche	Love This Game!	I am obsessed with this game. Ao many different dragons and elements! Dragon suggestions: voodoo, chef, parrot, stuffed, book, fashion, spaghetti, milk, wood, skeleton, star/constellation, dragon for each planet, glass, light, cupcake, flower, soup, smore, cave, meadow, ocean, and lastly there could be a cheese/mac n cheese dragon. :) I'm hungry.
US	5	2015-07-04	1.4.1	Marie woods	Dragon mania	"I have always loved games where you can raise, bond, and battle with animals, especially dragons or other mythical creatures. I swear that I have looked at almost every game about raising dragons, played them and then deleted them out of a dissapiontment, not to be offensive but, NONE of them have ever grabbed my attention as much as this one! This graphics are great, the special effects are very sudden and random so I always kind of jump when I hear a random growl from my regal dragon, and the dragons colors and ability a always surprise my friends! Most of them have already begun asking about it and seeing if they could download it! This game is always fun to play! With the new islands an the excitement of hatching a new baby rain dragon and/ or other. Whoever had the idea of making this game must have put  in a lot of hard work and studying, so they could understand what us dragon lovers wanted! Thanks for making this game an I hope whoever made this game knows that because of this I have one more thing to look foward to doing each and every day ! Oh p.s I would really love if you made a ying yang island representing new dragons dark and light! I've always loved the ying yang dragon , hopefully ill be able to breed it soon......... But I've never really been able to place it on an island were it belongs. Also if you could make more animal dragons like wolves and cats I'd sure appreciate it! Oh and I had an idea, its probably really stupid but ill put it out there anyways, what about doing zodiac dragons every once in awhile , including the cat!!!!!!!! For like the monthly dragons. Also can you make dragons less expensive.  Whenever I see like a monthly dragon I like I can't buy it because it cots like 2,536 gems. The highest I've gotten is 75 T.T....... I would really love it and I think others would too! Sincerely, 

Marie woods age 13"
US	5	2015-07-04	1.4.1	Cscfrog	Best Game I Ever Played	I love this game and the newest update. And that the game is pretty balanced. I thought this would be one of those dumb dragon ball z things (not hating on Dragoon Ball Z) but it's a very good game .

US	5	2015-07-03	1.4.1	Khatbert69	I like it!!	One of the few games in this genre that has kept me going for months. They are continuously adding new dragons and things that fill gaps. They haven't dumbed it down you have to be patient and consistent to be successful. They are very generous with premium gems and it's a long way from most pay to win games. Very happy with it plan to keep playing unless they do something dumb just to make more money.
US	5	2015-07-03	1.4.1	Maddie_2130	Awesome!!!!	This game is awesome it has the cutest dragons and you can pet them and feed them like a real pet

US	3	2015-07-02	1.4.1	thefiter	Super Fun but with Glitches	I've been playing this all day, and so far it's be really addicting and quite fun. HOWEVER, my game keeps 'resetting' thus causing me to lose a lot of progress. I can gain it back, but it's getting pretty annoying. Plus it caused me to lose a whole hour of VIP time. If I didn't have these issues then this would be at least a 4 star - maybe 5 star - game.

US	4	2015-07-02	1.4.1	Drew102894	Love it but one thing...	This game is amazing. I'm so addicted to it. I only wish that they let you have more than one breeding den, hopefully they change that in the future, then ill give it 5 stars. Other than that the game is great.
US	4	2015-07-02	1.4.1	DaniaAM	Whoooop	Great game, I only hate the fact that the energy base is so low and that dragon eat was too many food when leveled up, it's epic awesome nice other than that
US	4	2015-07-02	1.4.1	Greatly Disappointed 😣😣	One thing...	The only thing I think could be fixed is gems need to be easier to get. Otherwise great game. Love it!!

US	5	2015-07-02	1.4.1	Sparkle Kat	This is the best dragon game ever! PLEASE READ	Dragon mania is the best dragon game ever. It's got good graphics, a fun premise, and you can actually understand what's happening! Some things I must say are a little cheesy, like the name Dunkelviking, but it's very fun! The only thing I would add is you get the prairie dragon when you connect to game center, not Facebook. Don't waste your time on any other dragon game, get this one!!!
US	5	2015-07-02	1.4.1	D38lk	Great game...but	I really love this game and can't to play it. But where do you get gems and scrolls? I found places to get a few, but it is impossible to play this game without purchasing gems with real money. You need gems to get energy to fight the dragons in the arena, you need gems to buy scrolls to upgrade in dragon academy. So if anyone can do it without buying gems I sure would like to know how. I do love this game though and that doesn't deter me!

It does have some minor probs with wifi connection but other then that u should get this game. So when ur bored u have something to do that is fun and u compete with others. If ur can be competitive this is a game u should get!

         Thanks"
US	5	2015-07-01	1.4.1	Mr.kmk	Love it!	This game is full of fierce, lovely, goofy, and adorable dragons and I wanna get them all! This game is full of things to keep me entertained and delighted day after day. I love the events that come up regularly and the great prizes that can be won during each event. I also really appreciate the free apps, such as this one, that offer helpful in game purchases without making them absolutely necessary to your progress. I am super excited about the new 'fountain of youth' so that I can revisit the cuteness of my adult dragons! 😄 Dragon Mania Legends is a wonderful app!
US	5	2015-07-01	1.4.1	Meyercoyour	Light and Shadow Type Dragons	So, I know there're quite a few types and all, but what about adding Shadow Dragon and Light Dragon types? (If they don't exist) The only thing in my opinion is that these aren't exactly the normal dragons you breed and all. Turns out, these dragons (whether a Viking has one), when they attack one of your dragons, they may cause your dragon to drastically change, adding them another type (ex: attacked by a shadow dragon, it gets the shadow type, ect.) or, it may change them entirely. Once your dragon has gotten used to it, they can switch from normal (regular form) to shadow/light.
US	4	2015-07-01	1.4.1	{Liva1214}	Great game	Overall it's a really fun game, good for kids too. It's got awesome dragons, very active game, very addictive too. It gives you about 30 gems to start with... But it could use a little more dragons and make them easier to breed. Also pop up ads. Bad with this game, your right in the middle of doing something with your dragons and you accidentally push the ad and it takes you to the App Store or the intranet, it gets really annoying at times but it's a really good game to play.
US	5	2015-06-30	1.4.1	Sagepix	Pet Dragons	Ever wanted pet dragons that you can feed, fight with, buy items for, and breed? Here is your chance. You can explore ruins by sending several dragons to look for treasure, breed dragons to get powers or certain aesthetics, farm food for your dragons, and have them fight other enemy dragons. The graphics are great, and the interface is smooth. Amazing game that I highly recommend for users of all ages.
US	5	2015-06-30	1.4.1	S'oney	Love it!	I love dragons and it was hard to find a game that I could get into. It can be time consuming but the graphics, layouts, and challenges make it worth the time. One of my favorite parts is how cute the baby dragons are after hatching. Breeding is a bit over the top in time consumption though. I don't think I will ever get bored with this game.
US	5	2015-06-30	1.4.1	bevcen	Awesome	Awesome game
US	5	2015-06-30	1.4.1	Dragon born 1077	It is awesome	It is so cool people who made this game make another one plz👍
US	3	2015-06-30	1.4.1	Mrh4276	Pop up ads are horrible	Overall the game is fun. I spent way too much Time playing at. The pop-up ads are very annoying, they always manage to pop up just is you're in the middle of clicking on something. that causes the game to close an app store to open, and that takes time. It would be one thing if they were dependent on ad revenue to pay for the game, but all the pop-up ads are for other games they produce.
US	5	2015-06-30	1.4.1	Julie1177712347	BEST DRAGON GAME	best dragon game in the app store!  BUT I just wanna play the game without needing to buy gems can you make it easier to earn them please. Overall the new update is cool I just got it but It makes the game 5 times better!  There are some things I would like fixed that the other players have already mentioned. So please read their reviews

US	3	2015-06-29	1.4.1	Skiblk	Cool game	This is a really cool game but it gets too expensive at higher levels. Dragons need too much food to keep growing.

I'll tell you about the game you can breed to dragons and feed and pet your baby dragons.you battle and all the time you will win but might lose dragons but they will still be at home so ya it is awesome.
US	4	2015-06-24	1.3.0	Hayley rh	Love it minus a couple things	The game is really fun and I play it on both my phone and laptop. There are a couple annoying things though as other reviewers have mentioned. I wish the game let players sell or stop breeding/hatching dragons that are repeats. It just wastes a lot of time if you get to higher level dragons. Also friends are hard to get without annoying Facebook invites. Lastly, gems are really hard to come by and things cost an outrageous amount of gems. In other games you have to pay real money for gems too, but this game rarely awards them which can make the game move very slowly at times. These are all nit picky things though, overall the game is great.

"Ok, so here I am playing this really fun game, and then you breed a dragon, spend some coins/gems, complete an achievement, whatever - and then you put it in the hatchery and WAIT FOR 12 HOURS! The only dragons that take less than 1 hr to hatch, are the really basic and boring ones like fire, earth, and water. I am currently waiting for 4 different things in ""Dragolandia"" right now, one of which is for my portal energy to refill, allowing me to fight ""Vikings."" So answer me this, game loft. WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DOMWHILE YOURE WAITING? Write a long review about how you're waiting? Cause that's what I'm doing at the moment. This is my favorite game, but I hate waiting, and I don't need more."

The dragons are so cute! A great job to the creators of this game! Keep up the good work!

I just wish that we would be able to name our dragons and that we didn't have to wait to fight while energy is replenishing. I wish it was a little easier to obtain coins, because I feel like everything is more expensive than what we can get without having to use real money to pay for jewels. Overall, I do really enjoy this game and love playing it, but I just wish it was more geared towards user satisfaction rather than more ways for the maker to earn money.

US	5	2015-06-16	1.3.0	PrincessAngel96	AMAZING game!!! <3 💕	If you love games like DragonVale and Dino City, you'll love this game! But it's a bit more unique because it has a storyline and quests and it's just amazing(:
US	5	2015-06-16	1.3.0	~Ahmad74	f4fb0	Please, type the code (f4fb0)
US	4	2015-06-16	1.3.0	GeneC08	Good	It was great until they made some change to challenge people. It lost some of it goodness when they did.
US	3	2015-06-16	1.3.0	Italyluvsgermany5ever	Cute	"Cute.
Cute, but at times frustrating because of the nature of its quest based leveling up."
US	4	2015-06-16	1.3.0	Marco501	Very fun	I like a lot but I can find how to move objects around.
US	5	2015-06-15	1.3.0	🐶🐱Nora	Out of this world🇧🇷	This game is so amazing!My whole family plays it.You can make really yummmy dragon food and my dragons eat it like it's 🍥 or 🍦.You can collect many wonderful cute and colorful sweet dragons.If you pet them sometimes they shed gold.You can battle so many different dragons with different attacks and different levels.I hope you enjoy this terrific game
US	3	2015-06-15	1.3.0	Baconlover1331567	Good game overall, but....	"This game is fun but the dragon league system is broken. You constantly have to deal with ""hard"" trainers 10 levels higher than yours. Almost nobody is ""medium"" and not many are ""easy"". If this is fixed, 5 stars."
US	5	2015-06-15	1.3.0	MarkV915	Good game.	So far this game is good, the dragons in this game are unique, and great. Really good.
US	5	2015-06-15	1.3.0	Kfgkfbcuf WhoCares	Adorable	This game is frankly adorable. But, like kittens growing up, the cute factor drops to a mere grin. One thing I particularly dislike is how little room there is and how expensive things are as well. Not to mention the fact that some of the quests lie. Not just mild misleading, they lie. An example is an early on quest involving lava dragons. Lava dragons are actually crap. Before a recent update, pop up video ads abounded without warning, too. It's as if they are trying to use the cuteness as a crutch, trying to hide the flaws behind big-eyed Dragons. The dragons are mostly cutouts, so probably add more models please?
US	5	2015-06-15	1.3.0	Hvgggfsg	Great game!!!	Super fun

US	2	2015-06-14	1.3.0	Extra0404	Ready to delete it	I've been playing this game for months but once I got enough habitats when I collected my gold the game would reset so I would have to recollect it 2 sometimes more and maybe that's a little thing but once it happens every time you start this game for weeks it starts to get old

It could be a whole new building or an upgrade to the breeding den. I hope you will consider implementing this feature in the next update it would be AWESOME!

US	2	2015-06-10	1.3.0	mqnwbevrctxyzu	Culturally Offensive Dragons	Please remove the culturally offensive dragons from this game, such as the tribal and tololoche dragons. The game is fun, but these dragons based off stereotypes are upsetting.
US	3	2015-06-10	1.3.0	Bigfoot 7691	Love the game but!!	"Love the game but we need an easier way to get friends. Facebook is not the way to do it. We should be able to get in game friends. To many things I can't do without having friends in game. Please help.

Also, after playing for a bit, the base structures stayed the same. Please make more base structures, and no pop up ads. Then, this game would be a five star. Otherwise, I actually enjoy this game a lot."
US	4	2015-06-06	1.3.0	EmJay anomynous	Amazing!😃😃😃	This is so great! It has all different dragons with different talents! It's a wonderful world to explore!
US	3	2015-06-06	1.3.0	KatchyKDelightfulD	Ehh...	At first it was running perfectly but than when ever I would try to collect gold from just one habitat my game would have to reconnect. It's getting very annoying and I don't know how to fix it. I've tried deleting the app and redownloading it. Please help!!
US	5	2015-06-06	1.3.0	Me2012$	so far so good	like this app more than similar games I've played. So far it hasn't forced me to purchase anything so I'll keep the 5 stars in the mean time.
US	4	2015-06-06	1.3.0	Boo to crashing	Thanks for the consideration	"Thank you for taking care of some of the past issues I had with the game. That daily rewards glitch has been taken care of, and some of these additions to the game (despite the 3 on 6 battles being Bull$#!t) are pretty neat. The small amount of dragons available in the dungeon is extremely underwhelming though. Specially since it was build up so much. Please put more effort into it later.

Aside of that, the game still remains one of the best raising games I've ever played. It makes a  rather simple battle system at least feel important with how much one simple choice can decide if you win or lose. It has a variety of cool little dragons, n quite a couple of thins to do with them. I must admit though. There's one part of the gam that has gotten painfully irritating to me, and to many alike, and its the leveling system. Seriously, because farming can take so long and go away so quickly with high leveled dragons, the game can become painfully repetitive as you try to make SOME part of your powerful dragons grow. And because this game expects you to grow so quickly, it forces you to stop and farm, and feed, and farm, and fee, and farm, and fe- f@&k guys! Please add or modify this system. It is the one worst part of the game, and it can easily be fixed with some other options for growing dragons. 

And give the decorations some kind of purpose, outside of being decorations. Although they are nice additions, since they don't help in any way, they only make issues like what I mentioned earlier, incredibly infuriating."

US	4	2015-06-05	1.3.0	eVortex	Cool Battling	"When I started playing it was really fun. Battling is probably my favorite thing in the game. 
The thing I noticed as I leveled up was that all the dragons were based off the same few models. Where in a game like DragonVale all the dragons are unique and have more variety. Besides the dragon designs, I think this is one of the best dragon games I've played (besides DragonVale)."

US	2	2015-06-04	1.3.0	Ipad081	Many problems	This is a great app at first, but once you get more active in the app it crashes, glitches and has problems left and right. This is a fun app if it works properly yet it normally does not work properly when you use it. I have encountered many bad experiences in this app and I don't recommend it to be a game you regularly play.
US	5	2015-06-04	1.3.0	Busy mom and nursing student	Good game	Like it
US	4	2015-06-04	1.3.0	ThaRastaDude	Decent	Decent game a little childish... When I think of dragons I think of them as being huge wish dragons got bigger
US	4	2015-06-04	1.3.0	TalaRayne	Suggestions	This game like many others, is cute and provides entertainment all day. But like all of the rest, it's all so expensive and you get very little. I won't complain about the gems (though I should),but the food could be just a bit cheaper, offer more per crop, or take less to level up your dragon. Plus the amount to clear obstacles is ridiculous. 500 for small rocks? I could be using that money for food or habitats! If you want the have more success with this game, be a little different from the rest. If you give the people what they want, they'll keep coming back and earn you more money.

I'm sure a few of you have heard about the phones that are getting notifications when trying to update or download new apps saying that your payment method isn't valid. Because of this, I can no longer play this game as this problem is not fixable. I would appreciate a way to continue playing my game without having to update, as I can't.

Please make it able to pause battles instead of making people lose battles and energy even if they were winning and never completed the battle
US	5	2015-05-29	1.3.0	Silver_rising	No	Yes
US	5	2015-05-29	1.3.0	Brisk-Oh	Great game; best customer service!	I love this game, but let me say that the customer service is so excellent that it totally amazes me! Thank you, Gameloft!
US	5	2015-05-29	1.3.0	Rodmaster119860	Best game	It is amazing but you should make it that when you get to a specific level the diamond group cost gold
US	4	2015-05-29	1.3.0	Zaky3009	It's good	They're cute. Lol no but on the reals more dragons to combine and maybe a guild to go into battles... Other than that looks dope
US	4	2015-05-29	1.3.0	Little T Junior	Awesome but...	I have been playing this game for months and love it. Problem is that its so hard to level up the dragons. Its expensive and takes so long to grow. I prefer this game to dragon city. However I also play monster legends and like that you can level up through battles as well as with feeding. I wish they would do that with this game. Would love to be able to find or receive gems more easily too.
US	3	2015-05-29	1.3.0	Dragon2543	Good at first	I started playing DragonVale several years ago, until I discovered Dragon Mania Legends a few months ago.  The game is fairly similar to many other previous dragon games, like DragonVale and Dragon City.  The battling system is good as well as the graphics, but it just seems boring after a while.  All of the dragons are basically based off of the same base model, and basically have the same fundamental structure, which takes away the uniqueness.  The dragon Chronos, which players can collect, is very similar to Kairos from DragonVale. Both are obtained using shards pieces collected by questing, and they both reduce timers, but Kairos  was created long before Dragon Mania Legends came to the App Store.  The battling system is fun at first, but it becomes harder as you progress, and actually winning a decent prize by fighting in the arena isn't the easiest thing to accomplish.  Dragon Mania Legends is a good game, but it could be better.

US	4	2015-05-28	1.3.0	Sini42	Mostly good	Unlike some other dragon games, this one is multi-faceted and still growing.  Some aspects are nearly unwinnable due to a pay-to-win situation, but withy the most recent update they're beginning to address that with tiers.  It's a fun game!  (If you found this helpful, please use my referral code so we both get a prize: e9d9)
US	5	2015-05-28	1.3.0	Moonlightmask	A fun game	I just star playing this game, and it's so far so good now. It's kind of raising dragons and use them to fight to collect resources. Then u use these resources to build  stronger dragons.
US	4	2015-05-28	1.3.0	Makenzie@	Upset otherwise though.....	"Dragon mania is a ok game. Fist of all it deleted my game data when I got the latest update. I work for years and was so ready to finish the game. I WANT MY GAME BACK!! I cried and cried and hated dragon mania for a long time. Please give me my game back and I will thank you for a lifetime. Please give ,e my game back.
                           Now besides that I really like this game. I really like the a animations and this is a very realistic game. My favorite dragon is the boss tesla dragon. I think it is very powerful .
                             Please give my game back and I will thank you for a life time PLEASE I WANT MY GAME BACK!! Please download too😬"
US	5	2015-05-28	1.3.0	Mcw20	Fun new content is cool	I like the game have been playing for 5 months now and I play everyday. The dragons are cool those I wish there were a few more different base models to design around. I wish the gems could be found more often like if the boss dragons generated gems everyday like the regular dragons made gold. When you fight high level dragons and win you should always get food. Food is the most limiting factor in this game for me

US	1	2015-05-27	1.3.0	Surfer and skater girl	READ	What's so violent but the this game is ASOME
US	4	2015-05-27	1.3.0	Aaron'(:	I like the game but..	I think the new update was a complete waste. The dungeon is the dumbest thing about the update. You only have 20 hours to win, but as soon as you have run out of stamina you have to use your own gems to revive your Dragons. Or else you can't revive them.
US	4	2015-05-27	1.3.0	Duqapus	Great Game!	This game is so fun  and addicting that I can't stop playing! Some things are annoying like sometimes it reloads in the middle of a fight and you lose energy or not being able to rename the dragons. Or at least I haven't found that part yet. But the game is really cute and interactive! So get it =_=
US	5	2015-05-27	1.3.0	Ninviod	I love it	Love the dragons+breeding-wish there could be infinite habitats not based on level

Thank you for making this game"
US	5	2015-05-25	1.2.4	Yaninaaaaaaaaa	Very addictive game	My only problem with the game but it's small but can't name dragons ,but it really doesn't matter
US	5	2015-05-24	1.2.4	McKinley loves apps	Cool	This game Is so cool that you can have so many cool  dragons and farms and portals
US	3	2015-05-24	1.2.4	Ravenlob7	Entertaining but lacking.	This game is extremely entertaining and you will spend hours playing it, however, the game is lacking depth. No end game content. DML offers plenty of things to do from collecting and breeding dragons, playing the campaign map and playing against other members for ranking in an arena style mode. This makes the game useful as a time sink, but because the game has loading issues and various bugs affecting gameplay and player status as well as a lack of end game content I give this game three stars out of five.

US	5	2015-05-21	1.2.4	Lgrayce	Love this game	wonderful game, but to be perfect and deserve 5 stars need to tailor the arena to the level of the dragons of each player, for today only appears difficult, it is impossible to win and accomplish missions.
US	5	2015-05-21	1.2.4	NickiWinter	Super	Addictive!
US	5	2015-05-21	1.2.4	Corky Lawrence ahaaa!!!!!!!'n	Best game ever	This game is the best of all games I have ever played
US	5	2015-05-21	1.2.4	HeckYesHess	Loss of progress	I just found the game last night, and seemingly when i leave the game and come back in i have lost most of my progression. All the food for instance i used to level up my dragon to level 11 is still gone but my dragon is back at level 8. All the gold i spent training my dragons is gone but the two dragons i trained no longer are trained. And lastly i have leveled up to level 10 THREE times already. Please fix this or i cannot continue to play. Im sick of doing everything over again every time i log in. Oh and all the battles i won now looks like i never fought them in the first place. Great game otherwise and i hope to change my rating but until this is fixed i wont.
US	5	2015-05-20	1.2.4	Winchester777	Brings back memories	This game reminds me of the good'ol days of Pokemon and  Tamagachi
US	2	2015-05-20	1.2.4	ContraryStream	Dragon mania	This game has cute dragons but unless you want to buy a lot of gems, it is a slow agonizing game. You can't level up your dragons to fight because they keep capping off until you reach the next level- which you cant because you lose because you cant level up your dragons!! So you spend days petting them for coins to spend on clearing land trying to level up. Not sure why I keep playing 😕
US	5	2015-05-20	1.2.4	Branbizz	Love the game	I really like this game, I would Chang how much it cost to take out trees and stuff

Sometimes it just freezes up and it takes way to long to load. Another thing you should enable playing offline so you can play when not in a wifi area. Just a few bugs to fix and this would be a five star game!!

US	5	2015-05-13	1.2.4	Lexi Barnett	FOOD DRAGONS!!!	So there's all these dragons following the theme of the month or for a contest.. So why not have food dragons!?! Have them be in completions and able to breed. If you add food dragons this fun classic game would have a whole new twist!!😆 Examples: Fast food dragons , Sweets, Salty, Spicy! And many more ~ Lexi
US	5	2015-05-13	1.2.4	Abbymwebb	AWESOME GAME	Most games that I play I don't play them very long.But this game I play everyday.I like how you get to breed,battle,go head to head,feed your dragons to level them up, and you can level your habitats.I am always excited to see what my dragons have made when I breed them.I don't care what anyone says about dragon mania legends I love it.

BUT I hate how u can't put dragons in the inventory i tried to move one of my dragons to the inventory so i can put another dragon in its place but there is no button for that. I would give it 5 stars if you guys make an update to put dragons in the inventory.

US	3	2015-05-12	1.2.4	Shigmerotten	Um okay	Well I was excited to see the game finally on iPhone apps, but the play is not the same. It seems like a money pit and my kids don't understand when I say no we aren't getting it because it wants another $5. Hope it gets better with age. Also do not like that the streak total resets. I don't see myself getting more than 4 wins ever.

US	5	2015-05-10	1.2.4	Ale 😘💋	Just got i	This game is super cool!!!
US	5	2015-05-10	1.2.4	Snaugmaster	An adorable game!	"Unlike all the other games like this it is not just tap but allows you to interact with your dragons. I love it! 
I only wish it didn't need internet."
US	2	2015-05-10	1.2.4	Matt00098403	Too glitchy	It's a fun game. Like any other freemium game, every decision that went into making this is about getting you to spend money. That I can live with. I've been playing since and they still haven't fixed the major glitch. This game disconnects constantly and loses your progress while keeping your resources. Very sad.
US	5	2015-05-10	1.2.4	EditedCookie	Awesome	This game is truly amazing
US	1	2015-05-10	1.2.4	Mittens007	NEEDS AN UPDATE	This game is fun but it crashes and says there's no Internet when I'm connected, it needs an update bad. I want to rate it a zero
US	5	2015-05-10	1.2.4	Jeter2243	Great Game!	Combination of Tiny Village and Pokemon. Just started but so far so good !
US	3	2015-05-10	1.2.4	Pizzalover7272	Good, but...	This is a pretty cool game, but the amount of food we need to feed our dragons is just too much to bear! Lower this! Also, I want to be able to name my own dragons. I do have a question: why is there a limited amount of habitats for each level to have? I think this is extremely stupid. I am having a problem with placing dragons on habitats and upgrading them. An egg has been in my hatchery for days because I have reached the limited amount of habitats and have to wait till the next level. Please read this review and make these adjustments. Then I can guarantee a five star rating.
US	5	2015-05-10	1.2.4	Eagle Eye...09	New Adventure!	"Dragon Mania Legends is just breath-taking, exciting and so diverse. The new-born Dragons are so cute! Adorable! It's an improvement to the other dragon games out there! 
It's just an amazing adventure that brings new meaning to the gaming world. It's a new world, dragons breathing fire to give you a scream. The adult dragons just slash at each other, eat, gather gold, and storm the battlefield! Its exciting and fun, the gaming world needed a new idea to rekindle the gaming world, and know the gaming world is officially back on track. Dragon Mania Legends is just an amazing game! Its just, just, well you'll have to play it to believe it!

US	2	2015-05-09	1.2.4	KrAZyhorn	Even though nobody will read this...	"Well Iv had this game for about two weeks or so and I was really starting to enjoy the game but out of nowhere I tried to place an egg and it had a sort of question mark on it and it said to download more stuff to the game to get it to work right and for the first few times it did that I didn't really mind but it happens almost every time I go in now and not just with my eggs but with a lot of my dragons too but the problem is no matter how many times I ""downloaded"" the thing I needed to it said after a little while (exiting out of game completely and going back in) that I needed to do it all over again and I'm starting to get worried about if it is continuously using my storage. If this isn't fixed soon I will be deleting the game and getting a better game that involves breeding dragons and fighting and everything but it isn't like it's going to matter or anything because even if someone reads this I doubt they will do anything about it"
US	5	2015-05-07	1.2.4	Gftsrfh	Good	Pretty good but it would be better if there were larger than 3 on 3 battles

US	5	2015-05-06	1.2.4	Mick 1782	Great game	This is the best one of these dragon games that I've played so far, I really like that the dragons are more animated and created well unlike some other games.

US	3	2015-05-06	1.2.4	1736291099529106557jekeo	Glitches	Alright so I rarely write reviews, but this has been ticking me off. I enjoy the game, really. The loading times and everything don't bother me. What DOES bother me is when I go into battle, it randomly disconnects, and I have lost the energy but did not have my reward for winning and this has happened several times. There's also been incidents where I've built something and upon pressing the XP star it just disappears, reloads, and then my money is gone along with the building. Come on! I know I have a stable internet connection, I've even tried resorting just to 4g. This is a serious and irritating problem that's pushing me away from wanting to play at all.
US	5	2015-05-05	1.2.4	Awesome132462	Awesome	Good game!! I'm not really into the building city games but this one got me hooked on it!!

US	1	2015-05-04	1.2.4	iTunes freak/maniac	WHAT DID I DO	I like this game, but why does it keep telling me I have been hacking? I haven't done anything in the game except get to level 2, but it keeps telling I am doing something wrong. Help?
US	4	2015-05-04	1.2.4	⚡🔥✨🌟💫💥💢💧Ray ray	Ok	"I really really love the game! I do! But lots of times it needs to like ""reconnect"" or something and it is annoying because of you're in the middle of a battle you have to redo the battle but you lost your energy. Please fix all the reconnecting!"
US	5	2015-05-04	1.2.4	Jjcthfdjcdghvy	Meh	First of all you have to fix the game so you get your daily rewards at the time you are supposed but all in all a fun game

US	4	2015-05-04	1.2.4	Pollnow	Great!	This app is amazing and I love playing on it but I don't like ow you have to upgrade the hatchery with gems because I never will be able to so change that and this game will be amazing. It still is amazing and I enjoy it very much.
US	4	2015-05-04	1.2.4	Ok it awesome ish	Could have been WAY BETTER... 😕	It could have for one this game does not allow us to name our dragon 😱. My Earth Dragon was named Boti kinda sound like...- never mind there are little kids most likely reading this ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ star review. And you SHOULD make ️HTTYD 1and 2 dragons (️(HTTYD stands for How To Train Your Dragon) there are MILLIONS of fans of ️HTTYD movie(s) and about 30 min. Shows fix the no name problem and make ️HTTYD DRAGONS and I'll rate this review ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  yeah that right I'll do that SO PEASEE 😬😬😬😄😃😀😛😋
US	4	2015-05-03	1.2.4	Freddy/Jason	Addictive but...	It's a wonderful game although the prices can take you a long time to earn and the newly placed ads take you from the game into the App Store and frustrate you enough to stop playing. You can go against people online which is fun, and play the story..the games good. One you'd like. Just a few things keep it from being 100 awesome.

US	4	2015-05-02	1.2.4	Shahsvd	BEST GAME EVER! But.....	Omg I am addicted to this game!!!! Although, I wish that you could name the dragons. The names they give the dragons are terrible! One of my dragons name is lump😑 really? They also make the levels WAYYY to hard! They should be a little bit easier. Other than that, this game is amazing!!!!
US	5	2015-05-02	1.2.4	Cdgrzhp6	I LOVE THIS GAME❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️	"not to much ads

US	5	2015-05-02	1.2.4	Animal👽	The best dragon game out there!	I found this game from an advertisement in another game. The game looked cool, so I tried it out. Let's just say, thanks advertisement! :)
US	4	2015-05-02	1.2.4	The Shadow in The Mist	Hey Gameloft I love this game and all really awesome	Love this game really fun and awesome 2 problems lower the price on food or make us get more food out of it second I do online battles and then It just quits me out of the battle and I don't get my energy refunded I would really like it if you considered this message :)
US	3	2015-05-02	1.2.4	Kimsole	Disappointed 😰	This game is so addicting!!!!! It's my favorite game,but lately it was having some issues. You see my favorite part of the game is breeding the dragons,but lately there was a habitat error saying I already had 19/19 habitats when I only had like 5 of that kind I'm very disappointed I have contacted game loft about this issue,but if it comes to June and the problems not fixed I will have to part with my favorite app😥

US	2	2015-05-01	1.2.4	Lightingwolf	Good game but	The game is good but the gems cost to much you know we are not rich and saving up gems is a waste of time.So lower the breeding and the dragons. Thank you and good bye.

US	5	2015-05-01	1.2.4	Ameeblue	Very entertaining!	I love this game. It's like Pokemon, Dragonvale, and War Dragons all mashed into one, only you fight other dragons instead of destroy towns. The mini training and exploring games are also fun. Above all there is a large variety of dragons to get.
US	5	2015-05-01	1.2.4	RaspySleet	Great!	The game is great.
US	4	2015-05-01	1.2.4	easke	Addictive but has connectivity issues	This is a fun and addicting game that I have enjoyed playing over the past few months. Advancing through the levels gets progressively harder, primarily because you need food to level up a dragon and the higher the level, the more food is needed. So it starts to feel like all you can do is harvest gold to buy the food.  So goes the game.  But this game loses connectivity very easily for some reason unless you are next to an AP. Switching to cellular seems to make game play more stable but can drain your battery in short order. If this game had an offline mode, it would be great.
US	5	2015-04-30	1.2.4	Fluffyoctopusturtle	Hh	Please put the cosmos dragon up next month too. I just got the metal dragon and I don't have a habitat, so please put it up
US	5	2015-04-30	1.2.4	The new version of Madi	Love it	I love everything about it it's just a little tricky
US	4	2015-04-30	1.2.4	Shiest04	Great game but...	"I enjoy and like the game but I think the wait time for the food is ridiculous. So many dragons to fight at higher levels and trying to get my dragons to an even level takes forever!
Also you should add a repeat option for growing food for those of us who are growing the same things over and over in the farms."
US	5	2015-04-29	1.2.4	Enzomasespo	mr	This game moves well and is tons of fun
US	4	2015-04-28	1.2.4	AnimeTransBoy	Good creations	I love your designs for the dragons and the breeding them to make new dragons is so cool. The only thing I would have liked would be if I could personally name my dragons.

US	5	2015-04-27	1.2.4	Dolorhwang	great!	love this game! Has so much fun on it
US	4	2015-04-27	1.2.4	Appledamaster	OMG, YES!!!!!!!! Just one thing though:	"This is an amazing game that you do not have to pay real money for gems (I mean you can, but you CAN get them in game a little easier than most games of the same type), and the battle system is ingenuous. This includes the new Apple Watch settings!
I do have a suggestion though: Let the players rename our dragons.
That being said, I do have one problem with this game: Please try to remove the waiting times whenever I leave the app and come back in 5 seconds later and then be forced to wait a while for it to load. It gets really annoying. It defeats the purpose of leaving it the background. I would give 4.6 stars if possible, though."

 -players should be able to change dragons' names.

U don't get enough time to complete the tasks and when u do what is required u don't get enough items to complete the tasks.

US	5	2015-04-21	1.2.4	Blynnr73	Fantastic!	I've had this app for over a month now and it's the only game I've ever continuously played on my phone. The graphic design in spot-on. I feel as if there's a significant bond between my dragons and I. I also LOVE how you can accomplish things to get gems rather than always buying them like other apps.. You won't regret this game. :)
US	3	2015-04-21	1.2.4	Mome Angel	Great Game....But....	"Love this game! Has fighting, breeding, scroll winning, Academy Achievements to specialize, train & master your dragons, VIP Status and rewards.
BUT : 
Lately though, I've held off writing a review.  The exploring rewards don't warrant the rewards of 18 hours with 30k gold and 7.5k food!  Bring back the vengeful sword placement sound when fighting.  Plus while enduring this new update with it's undue difficulty in obtaining scrolls and the levels of fighters you are matched up against.  LOL Come on!  You call ""medium"" medium??  They are exactly like the ""hard"" levels.  Which ""mediums"" btw are 3-4 levels higher than you!  You don't want to make this game so hard for the lower level or even intermediate players, ahem that they quit!  AND...OMG the competitions??  Placing players against other players that are 10-20 levels higher than you???  Seriously??  this game is great in structure, although not in the reality of obtaining or advancing your fighting placement or your dragons.  Ease it up a little...please!!"
US	2	2015-04-21	1.2.4	AndreaK1124	2 Stars for Connectivity Issues	I really enjoy this game, but it is so frustrating to be in the middle of a battle and the connection drops out repeatedly. Also, I hate that you can't zoom out of your map more which leaves me scrolling constantly when trying to collect coins or level up dragons to send on missions. Breeding could use some improvement too. It seems really difficult to breed certain combinations that aren't even Epic or Uncommon level dragons.
US	5	2015-04-20	1.2.0	Foxywhite	Dragon	Great game! So Fun!! And really cute dragons, each having its' own unique qualities!!

US	5	2015-04-19	1.2.0	Coolgirl11111	Love this game	This game is awesom
US	4	2015-04-19	1.2.0	Crazyteachers	Fun but HARD 😞	I started playing when a friend told me about it. And I had seen it the App Store but I didn't download it until then. When I started playing it was really easy (to get the stuff you wanted and to defeat bad guys) but now with the player vs player option it's harder and my dragons are always needing to be leveled up. I love the game but it's so hard! You start out with a dragon and get more and then you battle Vikings. I mean that's cool! You'll see what I mean. Parents download it first!!!! Nothing inappropriate but I'm just saying. See if your kid would like it.
US	5	2015-04-18	1.2.0	MommaHanna	Sick Game Dudes or Dudets	It's awesome game with a good story line so everyone who sees this get the game!
US	5	2015-04-18	1.2.0	Dawn Burst	Amazin	I love it it's so cool especially the animation.
US	5	2015-04-18	1.2.0	Sly kitten	Dragon mania	Luv the challenge with Breeding different Dragons and see what I get..proud mama lol
US	2	2015-04-17	1.2.0	Ilene45	Used to be fun	Since the last update every time I go to arena I get kicked out. I have turned on 3 support tickets still no fix. I used to be able to breed different dragons might have taken a couple tries but you would eventually get them I am on my 20 try for breeding a sunflower and magnet to  get a dark machine it's a daily quest I have leveled my dragons to 25 and still nothing but same common dragons. Not a fun game anymore
US	5	2015-04-17	1.2.0	Dude3,009	Awesome	BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!get it now👍🏻
US	1	2015-04-17	1.2.0	Growling dog	Awesome!!!  I am so thankful that capitalism is alive and kicking!	With the new update, this game is pure pay to play. I will continue breeding cute dragons and farming slowly until they figure out how to charge for that. I cannot decide who to be upset with, the company for making profits by making a game not fun or the players for supporting this trend?  Hate the game not the player?
US	5	2015-04-17	1.2.0	Coll book	Best ever	This games is so awesome it makes me fell like dragons are real
US	5	2015-04-17	1.2.0	Anna Bo Bana	So far I love it!	Very user friendly and super cute. Just started and I'm enjoying it quite a bit! The graphics are well down and I even like the story line. It's got decorating, pets, battles and more. Well done game!
US	5	2015-04-16	1.2.0	Addbrab11	Awesome great amazing and free!!!!	This game is SO much fun and baby dragons are SO CUTE😍 a lot of fun download it now!!!!!!

US	5	2015-04-16	1.2.0	Hmarieh1218	Best game	Sooooooooooooooo awesome❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲
US	5	2015-04-16	1.2.0	PlasmaticClub10	Amazing!	This game is just like Dragon City, which you can havr as an alternative if you get bored of Dragon City. Also, there is a lot of events that make you earn prices! Simply amazing!
US	5	2015-04-16	1.2.0	RockandMetalLover	Pretty good, except...	Everything is quite expensive. Maybe if you guys over at development or whatever could lower the cost of everything just a little bit? Especially when you get farther in the game, everything is just super expensive. Other than that, I find the game quite enjoyable. 😊
US	1	2015-04-15	1.2.0	Fishtankdude	too many glitches	I love this game but am really tired of losing progress because of its inability to stay connected.  I've lost at least 20 fights at the very end because of getting booted out.  Also the daily rewards are not always received, really frustrated with this.
US	5	2015-04-15	1.2.0	Pants cxx	One suggestion	There should be a way to grow the same amount of food in every one of your farms by clicking one button
US	3	2015-04-15	1.2.0	Mezzz!!:)lol	Good and bad	This game was really fun then it bugged out and everything is maxed when it is really not
US	5	2015-04-14	1.2.0	Kosova 5100	Can you make another game?	"Dragon Manina Legends is 
so cool .i love bicause has a loot of dragons i just want to say can you make anothe r game with monster 
bicause that will be cool"
US	3	2015-04-14	1.2.0	lily3610	Awesome game!	Love this game and everything about it except I seem to have trouble connecting to the dragon league (multiplayer player vs player battles). Most of the time it just never connects except once in a blue moon which is frustrating because I know it's not me or my iPhone
US	3	2015-04-14	1.2.0	Jp-Quik Pik	Friends	I like the game but I can not connect with any of my friends that are playing the game. You give the option but do not let me connect to them, sending gifts, etc.
US	5	2015-04-13	1.2.0	URGAFURED	😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃!!!!	GET IT GET IT GET IT!!!!!!! The graphics are amazing. The fighting is epic! GET
US	2	2015-04-13	1.2.0	Norfolksouhtern	Money	This game revolves around money like the hiring a friends dragon. You can't do it without a vip account. It's asking for money ever chances it gets. I do not want to recommend this to friends because of this money begging.
US	4	2015-04-13	1.2.0	Dudedathastime	Good game	Fantastic game the only downside is that when ever I enter the campaign as soon as I go into a mission it ALWAYS lags me out and steals my energys so I can't beat a mission im stuck on without me lagging out plz fix this problem
US	3	2015-04-12	1.2.0	Gfdfujn	Good, but not great	After last update has lots of server issues. Fun game, but mines get stolen way too fast and unless you login multiple times a day and fork out cash it's impossible to advance unless you play for years.
US	5	2015-04-12	1.2.0	Inumaru1667	My game won't load	It keeps saying it needs to pull up the map then stays there and gos no farther
US	5	2015-04-12	1.2.0	MissKimH	Good game so far	Starting playing today. Found no issues and it can be fast pace.
US	5	2015-04-12	1.2.0	Iwhunter	Video Balloon	What is the point of the video balloon if there are never any videos in it??
US	5	2015-04-12	1.2.0	Scottylong06	It's Great! 👍	Good graphics and new things every week; best dragon game I've ever played. Beats Dragon City and Dragonvale. Keep up the good work!
US	4	2015-04-11	1.2.0	Tigeressjayne	Dude get this game!!!	This game is awesome you should get it but they need to make more easy dragons to breed.

US	5	2015-04-11	1.2.0	skrtskrtyeet	Awesome game	This game is fun and addicting. The only thing wrong with it is probably how long it takes to breed dragons and hatch them. But then again that makes you always want more.
US	5	2015-04-11	1.2.0	Boshiebear	So fun	Love it
US	5	2015-04-11	1.2.0	Vusjoihdtufeie	Fun and Addicting!	Great gameplay and good graphics! Download it now!

US	4	2015-04-11	1.2.0	Michelle Couillard	Great game	I love this game it's really fun. You take care of your dragons wile you play, feed, and compete with your dragons. There are islands to unlock making me want to play more. You can compete with other people too but you need to get to a certain level. I wanna play more and unlock dragons and islands. Some of the dragons shapes look the same just their color changes.
US	5	2015-04-10	1.2.0	10002130	Why can't I update	I can't update. It is making me upset. Now I cannot play. PLEASE make the update optional. My software update is 8.1.3 and it still will not let me update. Please fix this problem. I have read comments and you should have keep the game the same without updates.

US	5	2015-04-10	1.2.0	Myexclusiverose	Dragon Mania Legends	Just enough difference compared to other games like this one but more addictive I think. I can't seem to stay off it!
US	5	2015-04-10	1.2.0	Puchungo007	It's fun but	It's a really good game but everything in the game is expensive. You have to wait a while till you can afford to buy anything but I guess that's what keeps you coming back to play it. Lol.
US	5	2015-04-10	1.2.0	Duder323	THE BEST!!	This is by FAR the best Dragon breeding/training/fighting game out there! FIVE STARS!!!
US	5	2015-04-10	1.2.0	Ads ( hate them )	About the game	Great game and also nice graphics but it takes to much time to wait for the ads to load and disable so please fix that. The game is really fun I have a razor dragon and a emarald dragon . Love this game❤️❤️❤️✨
US	5	2015-04-10	1.2.0	Skbgogirl	Fun and addicting game	I downloaded this game for my 4-yr-old grandson. He loves it! What I didn't expect was to enjoy the game so much myself. We have a lot of fun playing together. Everything is too expensive as far as using gems, but overall a great game.
US	5	2015-04-10	1.2.0	Ad4wg 7	Addicting	This game is super fun and I would recommend this game to everyone. There's only one problem, it's way to addicting.
US	5	2015-04-09	1.2.0	Tupaquin17	Kind of addicting	Needs shorter wait time and more energy but other than that it's fun
US	5	2015-04-09	1.2.0	Fabianlovatic	Game	Amazing love it
US	2	2015-04-09	1.2.0	Robdehnel	Awesome game but ads need to go!!!	This game is awesome, it's fun to play lots to do PVP fight, pet the dragons, and get lots of gold. The thing that is killing me is the stupid AD's!!!!! I'm trying to get my arena score up to get agent dragon and what happens Ads pop up. Over and over and with the poor signal I get at home my game reloads. I have lost area battles and 8+ win streaks because of this. Ok if you want to PPP ads when you first log on that's cool but when you are playing NO!!!! Stop this NOW. Thank you for your time.
US	4	2015-04-09	1.2.0	Azcadillia	It's fun	I am enjoying this game but you run out of room for your dragons and u can only get your habitats up so high, and some of the prices of dragons r too high.

US	3	2015-04-08	1.2.0	Lady Feminist	Very fun! Takes a lot of time to get things going.	The pros for this app include a fun gaming and interactive experience with your dragons. The cons include a mini DJ game advertisement that you can't exit out of 80% of the time, so you either have to play the game for 45 sec or restart the app (which also takes 45 sec.) Many tasks take 30+ minutes such as growing food, mating/hatching dragons, and upgrading habitats.
US	5	2015-04-08	1.2.0	Tj1123211	Great app	Dragon mania is really fun lots  of dragons and tons of battles

US	5	2015-04-08	1.2.0	Pretty little liarssss	Dragons	Love the game
US	3	2015-04-08	1.2.0	Not there yet...	Fair game that learned to get greedy	"I started to play this so that my wife would have a friend to help open gates, and other challenges that were out there.  Playing this game originally was kinda fun (not really my type of game) but quickly revealed itself as the greed-fest it really is.    Mines get 'captured' by other players daily...  I have 8 mines, and every morning after I log in, I no longer control any of them.  The A/I ""cheats"" and powers up your opponents to a degree that your dragons cannot match.  Fighting dragons that should be 'Easy' can frequently result in a loss due to those 'easy fights' involving dragons that are significantly higher level than your own.  'Normal' fights normally require spending gems (read real money) to win.  If my wife walked away from the game, I would be happy to join her.  While I do want businesses to make money, too much greed quickly results in company failure."
US	5	2015-04-08	1.2.0	Horses rule 121!💁	Good but.............😱😱	This game needs less expensive stuff because I just bought the plant dragon and now I don't have enough coins to open the ship up and every time I get enough money it automatically says I don't have enough coins to do it!!! It makes me mad and frustrated. Other than that it is Great!!😋😋
US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Kittygalor04	Best game😄	Super fun it would be nice though if things u buy with $ was less and u got at least 3day bio or what ever u call it but other wise it's the best game and I injoy playing this game is my second fav game so far

US	1	2015-04-07	1.2.0	JrBSU	Ads Take over!!!!	Game was fun in the beginning but now the ads take over without tapping on anything and it changes your sound settings. It is a pain to deal with. They have also made the special events too hard to obtain and everything too expensive. Not worth wasting time or money on!!!
US	4	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Tensie74	Lost connection .	It makes me so angry when I lose connection bc it doesn't give you back the energy you lost!! I hire friends, use up my energy. The low and behold, the signal drops, and when it reloads my portals empty!! Please fix.

US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Bencl5	Fun game!	"I dig this game and highly recommend it.

The only change I would make is having the energy level drop after portal and arena battles.  If wifi drops during a battle it is lost until it is restored over time."
US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	GAGAORAMAFREAK	It's really great	I recommend this game to anyone who likes park simulation type games just one thing the creators should do is decrease the amount of gems for speeding up things but it's still awesome!

US	4	2015-04-07	1.2.0	AwesomeGarchomp	Addictive	This game is so addictive there are so many dragons that makes the game fresh and not boring. Although the cost for upgrades and dragons are kinda ridiculous as gems are hard to get
US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	ayeMoney29	I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!	this is the BEST game it's so much fun when your playing and exciting when your dragons battle and breed!
US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	CheezyChick	Fun Game	It's fun without any in App purchases, but worth it to buy to get to VIP at least once.  Then you can pretty much sustain it from there without having to spend more real money.
US	3	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Apryll Marie	...	Great family game. Love playing this with my 7 yr old.
US	1	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Demon lovers	No pharaoh dragon	I can't get the pharaoh dragon is it because I'm past the day I get it I'm past day 70
US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Ursogreedy	Greedy game	Why does dragons cost so much money? My son is three, he does not need hundred dollar dragons. Or should poor people not even bother?  This app and the App Store are SUPER greedy. Smh greed greed greed
US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Mad_Mama	Awesome	I've had this game or a while now. And while other games have come and I'd play them for a while then delete them, this one has stuck. I'm excited to see what the new update brings.
US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Leon Michael	So fun and cute!	I've played lots of these types of magical animal breeding games and I really enjoy DML's take on it. I love that it's more involved with petting and training your dragons. The cute animations and breed designs make it even more enjoyable. I love my Bee dragon and can't wait to see what other breeds I end up with.
US	1	2015-04-07	1.2.0	spookybell	Pop up adverts. Low excitement, no fb connection	I play with my boyfriend but we can't connect games for some reason.  We are the only people Facebook won't connect with.  Some pop up advertisement game starts after 45 seconds and can only be stopped by shutting the game.  Games within games are impossible to be successful in reaching one goal let alone 4 or 5.  Dragons are not customizable, can't even change names.  I play several tap dragon games and this is by far the worst. If it wasn't a connection I have with my boyfriend  I would delete it.
US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	VrishabhaBear	Excellent game	This game is a ton of fun! I like to compare it to Dragons World which I also play, although the dragon diversity in DW is far superior the game play of Dragon Mania puts that one to shame. The battle system is engaging, there's always fun to be had in the story battles and I found the breeding in this game to be more forgiving, you can get the dragon you want maximum inside of two days (I've got all my rare dragons within a few tries!) in DW it can take weeks. This game is fun, engaging. Total recommend from me.
US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Madsickle	AMAZING U SHOULD GET IT	Ok the first thing that I wanna say is that I seriously don't get the four and a half stars this game is amazingly addicting I have seen other adds for dragon games and they all look HORRIBLE!!! And I have this game and I have been comparing it to hay day and unlike hay day you always have something to do... For example: you can pet your dragons and you can fight other  people in dragon mania. This game is very unique  and I don't think you can find another game like it but if you have a different dragon game and you like it I am sorry about what I said but I hope if you guys get it you will enjoy it and I think you will so bye!!!

US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Beautiful blessing	Excellent	Love it
US	4	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Orchid10	Dragon Mania	Very interactive, fun game. I have dropped a star from my previous rating because I have discovered that since I play without using real money, I'm at a real disadvantage because some necessary items are so expensive in number of gems needed and there is no way to accumulate enough. Or enough scrolls. While trying to play the game, you would have to ignore the game and just go your merry way to possibly get enough of either. Very frustrating.
US	5	2015-04-07	1.2.0	Cherry s Dragons	CCB	I love the game.
US	5	2015-04-07	1.0.2	Pakitofhfh	Awesome	Great graphics, gameplay and all around fun
US	4	2015-04-07	1.0.2	Katesassy	Gold	There should be an easier to get gold like u could get a gold mine or something otherwise an amazing a that i talk about all day long with my friends and tell them they should get the game just think about the gold thing love this game also I don't like when people say a fire dragon or it's habitat cost to much and then it's so tragic and they had to delete the game because after u get the stuff like a day (at most) it will seem like nothing and the people who say the updates ruin the game I disagree I've been through about 5 updates and they all make it better but really  u should be able to rename your dragons the names are stupid and I bet the cheaters don't even read the reports and will never change anything from what a player thinks would be better

US	1	2015-04-05	1.1.0	Ljkjjhjjhjgh	Annoying Advertisment	This is one of the best Dragon Mania Legends ever played. After the update, everything went well until a 15 second advertisement pops up and forcing me to watch it and now that advertisement is starting to annoy me I'll stop playing the game for now for the next update or if  it continues with those advertisement. I'll WILL uninstall the game completely

US	2	2015-04-04	1.1.0	Aeranysa	Invasive ads	Video ads started popping up at random times about a week ago. Even if you have your music and game sounds muted, the ads are not muted. This is disruptive not only to the person playing the game, but to those around you. Ads that provide an in-game reward would be preferable. Or offer a premium version without these, at the very least. This just makes it not worth opening the game.

US	1	2015-04-04	1.1.0	doolbfossola	Bad bad and real bad	"Lets start off, now this game was fun for like the 1st week, then after that it takes a quick turn around to borning. reason why

- game has no real mechanics behind it, its use a dragon ability (1 of 7) an thats it. Nothing real special no upper animation. Cant mix and match spells. They all have the same animation no matter what dragon you get.

- once you get past level 4 your dragon goes through an evolution, just once. An thats it your done with you evolution of your dragon. You can fight, but not gain a single thing else. THATS IT!!

- They are of 4 molds. Look at all the dragons, there is only 4 skeletons, then a different style put on all of them. so why get anything different if they aren't even going to move differently.

- The weekly or month tasks DO NOT WORK!! It says get gold from your habitats. But they never work except for once a day. but you have 5 days to get to the end to get the newest dragon. which you CAN'T GET without spending gems which you have to buy or grind.  I could show video of how I tap a building i get 1 event item completed out of 12 that's it. but I have 12 habitats i pressed. Or the food or the hatchlings. Nothing NEVER works!!!

- Buying Gems thought I would give it a go, buy a 9.99 stack of gems thats when I actually wanted to try to get to different creatures. I didn't get my Vip week like it stated, and when i reported this to the game makers, they said well we need a bank statement!! What you don't keep track of what goes on. So customer service is horrible. Still haven't gotten my VIP week! Also it took them 3 days to respond.

- Fighting what should be easy pvp is just you going against the computer no real pvp and is extremely boring. feels like you're just facing the AI again (wait you are)

- you cant chat or mingle with out the players so this whole thing about making a guild, never happens.

So this game wears out its welcome after 2 weeks, its good for a quick check out but no long lasting ventures, if you are looking for long term this game is not for you.

once again if you looking for any help from the customer service you wont get it."
US	5	2015-04-04	1.1.0	mr.chair423@gmail.com	Beautiful	This game is a very beautiful game. It has fluent animations and great artwork. Nicely done!

US	3	2015-04-04	1.1.0	Blu jello	Water and metal?	I cant get a Mercury dragon cuz it say not compatible I want to make the dragon of the week but I can't cuz it says not compatible I can't breed water and metal or metal and water plz fix or help😣😔😵
US	5	2015-04-04	1.1.0	FIROM&MDFBVB	AMAZING!!!! 😍	I used to play Dragon City all the time, but my brother recommended this amazing game. It took me a while, but I finally did and it's so much better. The time is shorter for when you hatch eggs or upgrade buildings. It's a lot easier to earn gems and you can actually pet your dragons!! There's a story to go along with the game, as well. It's incredibly fun and super amazing!
US	5	2015-04-04	1.1.0	BrowMaddie	Love It!	I really like and enjoy this game! The only thing that bothers me is when I want to zoom out more to see my island and I can't go out that much! But other than that this game is great and I love playing it!(:
US	4	2015-04-04	1.1.0	Gravehonor	Loving it so far	I have tried a few breeding games or monster park games like this and this one is currently my favorite; might be because I love dragons but there are other reasons as well. This sounds small, and I'm not all about graphics but they're VERY nice. I'll end up looking at the water instead of my own island since it looks so impressive to me, hah! Also I love the music and hope you don't change it. My favorite loop is when there's mainly a wind instrument playing and I think just some nature sounds. It's so peaceful and I just love it. Also love the designs of the dragons thus far and I like there are other things to do other than just breeding. Only thing so far is the events seem pretty hard with all the steps you need to do and sheer amount if items to drop by low chance to progress. As much as I would love the bunny-dragon, I'm honestly not upset though if I can't do the event but still why I can't rate it 5 stars. Also VIP only events are kind of like a smack to the face but you need money somehow. Either way, loving it so far.
US	2	2015-04-04	1.1.0	DaJuLee	Deleting	"Updated April Review: played this game for a few months and now am deleting. There are lots of things to do in the game, but I couldn't progress any further don't have the habitat my new dragon needed. When I tried to purchase the habitat then there wasn't enough room to build it. Then I didn't have enough gold or gems to expand the land. Kind of a no win feeling so will delete.

Updated review: lowered my rating because I am already discouraged, finding out I need over a hundred gems to upgrade the hatchery. Am not patient enough to have to earn THAT many gems to upgrade stuff. Will probably delete app if my patience runs lower.  Will not recommend this game to my young family members who cannot buy gems to upgrade  or buy the dragons. price of dragons is ridiculous over thousand gems."
US	3	2015-04-03	1.1.0	HMSalesman	Something similar	It's a great game and all, but I noticed something. The dragons are just the same thing but with different styles to them. Literally their animations are the same, and really they don't feel unique. Do you think you could make some original designs, because I'm kind of tired of having 5 different dragons having the same design and the only thing different about them is body parts (horns, fire, ect.)
US	5	2015-04-01	1.1.0	HoneyBuns492	Really Great Game	This game is absolutely great. I highly suggest this game for any one who is a fan of dragons or story games (as in you have money, breed animals, and stuff). But it's like my favorite game in the world because you have your own dragons, breed them to make cool and legendary dragons, level them up, and like so much more! If you are thinking about getting this game hurry up and slap that GET button because you won't regret it (unless it has bugs but i highly doubt it).
US	5	2015-03-30	1.1.0	Mike100024.4	Dragon Mania Legends	I enjoy playing this game it is just like playing Dragon City. You have to do the same thing in this game just like what you have to do in Dragon City & that is to feed and breed your dragons to fight you will also have to teach and train your dragons how to fight and win but make sure that you always feed your dragons so they can grow up big & strong to fight and win. I hope that you will keep making more dragon games like these two because i very much enjoy playing them ii play them everyday. Thank you. P.S. I hope that you will be making some more dragon games that i could try it out to see if other people will or could fall in love with them just i did.
US	5	2015-03-27	1.1.0	Shark strong	Great game	Maybe puff the magic dragon void plant fire air
US	4	2015-03-27	1.1.0	Whodey8910	Great dragon battler	I really enjoy playing this game it has all the elements I look for in a game. First off it has great graphics and all the dragons look well thought out, also the battles are fun and interactive. Breeding dragons is fun as well the only reason I don't give it 5 and this is just my opinion is that then in app. purchases shouldn't be so high and it shouldn't take so much food to level up your dragons once you get past level 10. But I like this game a lot hopefully they keep updates coming good job developers

US	4	2015-03-25	1.1.0	Gabster2006🍦	Too expensive!!!	When I unlocked the metal dragon.Everything was expensive.Overall great game❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
US	4	2015-03-25	1.1.0	Kingofkings20x	Great game to pass time	This is a great game to play if you are looking to pass some time .... The only thing I don't like about this is when the load screen is complete you always get asked to rate the game .... And it's reoccurring when you have to re open the app... But since I'm doing this I hope it goes away... But still pleased with the game
US	4	2015-03-25	1.1.0	tristan709	Fun but..	"I love playing this game because you can interact with the dragons. But I dislike the custom names I think that we should be able to name them because they are our dragons. also it's almost impossible to get more dragons because you can only fit 2 in each habitat and in order to level up the habitats I have to wait till I'm on level 21 . please make room for more dragons in the habitats because some times it only expands the money. I need more room

I will rate this 5 stars if you change the problem"
US	5	2015-03-25	1.1.0	ThisIsBre23	Bessss Game	Great game play! Really fun!!
US	3	2015-03-24	1.1.0	DS G	Hard	I like the update except it's too hard now! The levels are harder to pass and it takes too many scrolls to level up your skills in the academy. The opponents in the Dragon League are always hard unless you constantly level up your dragons. It's hard to do that because the food takes forever make in order to feed them. Everything is just so hard now
US	5	2015-03-24	1.1.0	Dvvfgggfg	Dragon	This is best dragon game I've played really like it very fun try it

US	5	2015-03-20	1.1.0	Chris209994	Awesome!!	I rate the game awesome because of the gameplay..its way better than dragon city fighting with all your three dragons rather than one at a time..
US	3	2015-03-20	1.1.0	Sseeaa1435	I like it but it has WAY too many updates	"I really enjoy this game, but the constant updates get really annoying. I feel like every week I have to update each of my dragons just to play the game.
(Which takes like 4.00 MB) 
Can you stop that please...?"
US	5	2015-03-20	1.1.0	Warriorcatluverfurever	Plz read	"As one of the newest dragon apps on the app store, I love it. This only came out a few months ago, but it is gaining popularity at an amazing rate. I have played all the other ""dragon breeding and battling"" games, some for almost three years now. It has beautiful graphics, a good battling system so that you play with players at your strength level. It's easy to earn gems, as dragons actually PRODUCE them once in a while. The only problem I have with it is that  I can't rename them. :) Great game!"
US	5	2015-03-20	1.1.0	TJ0214	Since the Patch great experience!	Had a few issues when I first downloaded this game but since their latest patch it has been a really good gaming experience.  I have many of my family members playing this game and we have a good time trying to see who gets the rarest dragons.
US	5	2015-03-19	1.1.0	Bigbooger8	Add more sutff	Add more powerful dragons that you make by breeding your own dragons and you guys should gems you can get for free and add more ads to get more gems
US	5	2015-03-19	1.1.0	Monkey brains01234	Great Game!	I love this game, in my opinion it is much better than clash of clans. I highly recommend getting this game.
US	3	2015-03-19	1.1.0	Raven Nightwing	Dragons	This is the best dragon game I've found. People need to stop making special items that can only be bought with gems. I have a lot of games that for special things you have to have gems or diamonds or doughnuts. A lot of people don't want to waist really money for things like that.
US	5	2015-03-19	1.1.0	ThisEvilOne554577437	Fun game	Just started but I like it

US	5	2015-03-19	1.1.0	Aj green 4201	Great	Great
US	5	2015-03-19	1.1.0	Awesometin	Idea	this game is fantastic you don't need friends(facebook) to continue through the game but unlock certain doors ehh, but also there should be a way to give an egg that I breeded to a friend so if I breeded a double I could give it away, also I think you should be able to gift higher amounts when your higher levels and to prevent high levels spamming big gifts to new players is to put a level on you need to receive this gift Ex:level 1-10 gift 100 food(1+ to receive) level 11-20 gift 500 food(11+ to receive) ect... that would complete this game👍
US	5	2015-03-18	1.1.0	Fluberknocker	Awesome	This game was amazing thanks for realising it
US	3	2015-03-18	1.1.0	Gotron135	Good game but update not good.	It was an awesome game until the update. Now I have to download the dragons and it takes a while to do a lot please fix.
US	5	2015-03-18	1.1.0	It's sooo Fluffy!!!	Awesome Game!	This game is smartly designed. Visually it's very appealing. It also gives the gamer a satisfactory feeling of accomplishment by allowing the gamer to achieve different levels of success through a variety of activities in a timely manner.
US	5	2015-03-18	1.1.0	DragonML	DragonML	I think you should make your own oner and add more dragons
US	2	2015-03-18	1.1.0	Toothless89	Update ruined it	Was enjoying the game till the new update. It made it way to hard to progress in anything. I cant level up my dragons or win any arena battles. The game has become one sided.

US	5	2015-03-18	1.1.0	Olofathernick	This game is great!!!	Super incredible game, I LOVE it!!
US	1	2015-03-18	1.1.0	Nsp1red	Great game BEFORE the Update	This game was one of my favorites before the recent update. The battles have become impossible to win since you are pitted against dragons 5 to 10 levels higher than yours. I also agree food is very hard to grow in this game in order to be able to feed your dragons to get them up in level (my dragons are levels 21 and 22).  I have also found that when I do battles in order to get scrolls I am not always awarded the scroll when I win. Very disappointing. I would have highly recommended the game before the update but now I won't.
US	5	2015-03-18	1.1.0	Makenna carpenter	This is a really fun game!!!	I love everything about it! Hasbro always makes the funnest games! One thing is, it is kinda hard to collect more than 200,000 coins on the game you have to keep playing for a while. But since I am a dragon fan, this is probably going on my favorites list! Everyone should just try it at least once, because you will want to keep it forever!!!😀🐉

US	4	2015-03-17	1.1.0	Kieda1	Awesome but	The game is not like any other dragon game this is the best dragon game ever. There are some problems like it won't load even when I have three bars. It will also pop up random things. Sometimes it will collect the coins but won't give you the money for it. Please fix it.

US	5	2015-03-17	1.1.0	NiñoDragon	Good game	Excelente juego , muy divertido e bajado algunos otros pero este es el mejor
US	5	2015-03-17	1.1.0	2as1	Throws me out of the portol	I just started the game and I'm already frustrated, I paid 4 portal energy to play and I get kicked out and loss out on my portal energy, then I can't befriend my daughter on Facebook it won't allow me too, I don't have problems with joining in  on other games. I like the game but dislike the bugs in the game I won't buy any thing from the store until the games gets fixes,if any downloads the game ...be are how you spend your money...
US	4	2015-03-16	1.1.0	Sara the awesomest	Dragons	Really enjoy this game definitely recommend it to others. Easy to understand yet challenging in the right areas!
US	4	2015-03-16	1.1.0	SolidImports93	Cool	Fun!
US	2	2015-03-16	1.1.0	LizabethBro	Was pretty cool	"It's always been a bit repetitive and tiring to wait for the times but now it's worse! Times are so long and prices are high! I recommend Monster Legends over this. I wouldn't spend a penny on this game anymore.

Also it's glitchy and annoying. -.-"
US	5	2015-03-16	1.1.0	Dawnsitunes	Fun Game	Lots of things to do on this game. Very fun to play
US	5	2015-03-16	1.1.0	Sr Mickael	Really cool!	This game is lots of fun with lots of possibilities
US	5	2015-03-16	1.1.0	Mmaster2005	One of my favorite games!	This game is so well made and there is so much to do. But DragonVale is still my favorite dragon game. In Dragon City you can only battle when you first start. In Dragon Mania you can battle AND quest. Also the petting and feeding of dragons, SO CUTE!!! So if anyone is thinking about getting this game, GET IT.
US	5	2015-03-16	1.1.0	Sea silva	Fun	I really like this game
US	5	2015-03-16	1.1.0	D2088	Good game	I love this game because it has good details in the game and I think it is good for all ages!
US	5	2015-03-16	1.1.0	Fogujiychdddyg	AWESOME GAME	Ok so I am addicted to this game. The graphics are amazing and I love the player dragon interactions. The one thing I wish this game would have would be the ability to rename dragons.
US	5	2015-03-16	1.1.0	Zayer21	Fun game	A vey fun game a little different from other games like it
US	5	2015-03-16	1.1.0	Famous biker	Pretty cool	I like it cause it's simple and you don't necessarily have to get that far to have fun farming and breeding new cool dragons and there are lots!!!!!
US	4	2015-03-16	1.1.0	Adolf73269	Illuminati32	This really is the best city builder/dragon breeding/dragon combat game I've ever tried, and I've tried a lot. However, in the new version they raised the prices of pretty much everything. I liked it back when the academy skills didn't cost 1-6 million each.
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Pcgf340	🆒	🆒🆒🆒
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Things I like	It is a fun game	This is the finest game I have ever played.
US	1	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Jake 447	Greed ruined this game	With the recent update the game developer got real greedy and raised all the in-game rates while shrinking the rewards in a blatant attempt to get players to use real money in order to advance in-game. This went from being a nice, entertaining and appropriately challenging game to a ridiculous waist of time. Good job to the greedy tools turning this game from fun to flop!
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Melimel0205	Best Dragon Game I've Played	Fun game, graphics amazing, so many features!
US	4	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Gizmopug girl	Love it but..	Love it, the only thing I don't like is when breeding certain dragons it takes up to 6-10 tries which is a waste of time and irritating.
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Valacaraptor 321	Addicting	So fun and addicting
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	KaidaChi	Super Fun	This game is A LOT of fun. I love how the have the game set up, you interact more with feeding, fighting, and the dragons (you get to pet them). Amazing job and kudos to the creators
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Willenchen	good game	i like it
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Posts ;)	Deleted it	The latest update is ridiculous. I feel like it's a blatant attempt to force players into spending real money to make any progress. I deleted it, I hate it when people get greedy-I don't mind dropping a few dollars here and there and I have done so with this game, but I'll be darned if I am forced to do that just to play a game on my phone.
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Siomiomi	Love it!!	One of the best dragon apps out there!!!
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Monica Tyler e	Better than clash of clans	Can't wait to start dragon clans would be amazing and way better than clash I like that there are actual qwest and things to do
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Rcm1234321	I'm hooked	I love this game!!
US	4	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Cookie_crumbs	Fun game	This is a fun game! Although it is frustrating when you have to wait a really long time for your dragon eggs to hatch, and for your portal to replenish.
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Ms. Solimine	Awesome sauce	I think dragon mainia legions is pretty awesome, but the most fun part is when they battle, and they can't battle if the energy is out!!!!!😿😿😿😿😿😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😱
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Beasthicks15	I love it so much!	I love this game so much! No bugs or anything for me! I just wish the wait time could drop a little but I play this everyday!
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Hajahahh	Great game!	An amazingly addictive game. Must play!
US	1	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Squigly1965	Total cash grab	The previous version was ok. I gave it 3 stars. But since the new patch the greed of Gameloft has gotten to a disgusting point.  The have increased the cost of everything so you have to pay even more to try to catch up. The game comes to a standstill in the campaign. And arenas are now basically Pay to Play. It really is to bad I liked this game when I first started
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Jack wolf armor	Wonderful dragons I never knew	It's more discovery then dragon city
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Mannytom	Good game	I like these types of games

US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Chiken5678	Great game	Awesome game love the cool dragons and features of this game, Although knowing VIP doubles your win loot makes me sad because I don't have VIP
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Maggie Taylor	Awsome	This game is awesome because the dragons are pretty much free if you breed them
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	SweetSixteen98	Addicted 💕	This game takes over most of my time. The creators have found many ways to make this game as realistic as possible. I recommend it to everyone.
US	3	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Just ahit	It's ok	It's an ok game.
US	5	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Señorita bubba	Dragon mania	Amazing! Beautiful! I have one con, though. Chronos. I have 5 seals, and I haven't completed one section. And, I have a idea. Instead of selling dragons, why not put them on the auction! So, instead of waiting through eggs you don't want, put the egg on the auction! Anyway, beautiful game! Bravo!
US	4	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Le Nenuphar	Cool but.	I like this game. But some features are a bit expensive and hinder progress. Namely the cost to remove things off of an island. It was already expensive before. Now it's exorbitant. Other than that it's cool.
US	3	2015-03-15	1.1.0	CateHex	It's pretty good but...	"It's really good but you hit a brick wall very quickly when you hit around level 15 with your dragons. It's very hard to get scrolls after a short time and they updated things so the dragons abilities need 10 times more coins and scrolls.

Bug: There is a bug where sometimes you enter a battle and it doesn't load all the way, so you have to exit the battle and waste an energy. Which takes 20 or 25 minutes each to refill."
US	3	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Gennafer	Good until lvl 20	This game would be awesome if you could get your dragons pass lvl 20 but the food is very hard to grow in large quantities. It starts out costing about 10 coins per food then pretty much triples when you level up your farms.  Usually in games leveling up things gives you better deals. It takes about 3 days to get a dragon to lvl 20, and a month to get level 21.  Sometimes the battles crash causing you to quit in a battle and waste one of your energies, it's been like that forever and they don't seem to be trying to fix it.  I would never spend money on this game since it basically steals my in game money.
US	3	2015-03-15	1.1.0	Elderbugs	Enjoyable	I have enjoyed playing this game, but I get frustrated by games that require me to be connected to the Internet.  I ride a train to and from work everyday and would probably play more if I didn't need to be connected all the time.  If my internet any home goes down so does this game.  I wish there was a way to play the game without needing to be connected.  I understand needing to have it to compete against others, but isn't there a way to just connect when I want to?  I still enjoy the game.
US	5	2015-03-14	1.1.0	Bay194729482739582639	!!	BEST GAME EVER

US	5	2015-03-14	1.1.0	ary.treble	Best Dragon Game EVER!!!	I love this game so much! I usually don't play these kind of games, but this really hooked me! I love it so much! It always keeps me entertained! Usually games like this I delete after a week, but this one- there's always something to do... So I recommend this game very much! Thanks!
US	5	2015-03-14	1.1.0	Zoopals100	So much fun and so many features  to find!	I  LOVE this game so much! this is literally all i can say. xD
US	5	2015-03-14	1.1.0	Ba ba 😃😃😃😃	Supper fun	It's so fun and easy to play. But it also has some hard challenges which makes it more fun.
US	5	2015-03-14	1.1.0	Darky7264	An awesome VIP	Game loft can you people give every dragonml player a royal VIP ticket but do that as a update and also game loft put an update of boosting farms only for like 2 or 1 gems because some people like me don't like to wait also this game is so awesome
US	5	2015-03-14	1.1.0	F12gta	Cool	This game is so cool
US	5	2015-03-14	1.1.0	NanaStolp	Another Great Game	I've been playing Dragon Story for about 2 & 1/2 years now & Dragon City for a little over a year. I'm completely addicted to Dragons. Whenever I find a new Dragon game I have to try it out. But usually within a few days I find they just fall short. So I was skeptical when I started playing this game. I'm very happy to say that I feel it ranks up there with Dragon Story & Dragon City & in my opinion that is really hard to do. This game is a keeper!!!
US	5	2015-03-14	1.1.0	kwelch_1206	Great for all ages	At 25 I love this game as does my 4 and 10 year old children. It has beautiful graphics. A fun chance element with the breeding plus skill with the actual battles it's super interactive and all around a really fun game. And compared to many others I have only had this game crash once in the months I have been playing it. Keep up the great work!!!
US	4	2015-03-14	1.1.0	Yo mama57	PLZ HAVE TIMER ON VS.	I love this game but please add a time limit to each turn in the PVP matches people just leave and wait for me to quit when imp winning :P plz fix great game thou
US	5	2015-03-14	1.1.0	Rnjnunn	Jmn	Awesome
US	4	2015-03-14	1.1.0	ImTabbyC	Addictive game.	The game play is great, however I do have a couple issues w it. First off, the game isn't very stable. I log into it at times to find that some of it didn't save correctly. For instance I may have to redo battles, or I have lost gems and ect. Secondly, I have tried to add friends from Fb. When I do their name disappears from my list and theirs. But,neither of us have been put on the others list. Lastly the prices have just be jacked up way to high.
US	2	2015-03-14	1.1.0	Drewbiedooah	Update ruined it for me.	I really enjoyed this game for a while. It was fun, nice graphics and it moved at a reasonable pace if you didn't feel like spending real money. But then the update happened and it got exponentially more difficult. It pitted you against people well beyond your level in the arena, the cost of clearing your island and learning skills at the academy became well out of reach. It was all very frustrating. Then I remembered that I don't actually have to play this game. So long Dragon Mania Legends!
US	4	2015-03-14	1.1.0	Silvenium	My favourite breeding game.	"Nice graphics, good dragon designs. Cute, but not overly so (the unfortunate truth of many mobile-type games). Still has a cool factor, you know?

Either way, was in the late level 20's when the new update came out. Prices to train dragons had increased quite a bit. Am going to have to wait much longer to progress now (growing food for training, making money in general). 

Just warning you all: these later levels get pretty brutal, and you'll need a lot of time and patience to get any further."
US	5	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Dragon Queen 22378	Best Dragon game yet	I have played 7 dragon games none as good as this one and I'm crazy about dragons I want a dragon egg a real one too for my birthday this game is awsome sauce!!!!:):):):):);););) sorry I talk a lot cause I have a lot on my mind
US	1	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Batcher	I was enjoying the game	They just issued an update 3-12-15 and now in the arena they keep giving me opponents that the majority of there dragons are 5 to 19 levels above what I have.   I have NO chance of winning  I could see 2 or 3 levels.  As the title says I WAS enjoying the game and gave it 4 stars but now I Am cutting it back to 1

US	4	2015-03-13	1.1.0	SeaSaltSage	Fun, but recent changes no good	This game is great. However, the recent update involving scrolls make it a lot less fun to play. Scrolls are really hard to get, so when something costs 8 when it was 3 a few days ago? Cmon!
US	1	2015-03-13	1.1.0	jaxsailor	No more $$$ for you	I ask a question following the first feeding event.  I had already spent a few $$ on the game. I was not given a reply to my questions for a couple weeks.   My wife and kids understand the rules ... Take care of those that pay the bills.  Should I feel I reach the point I need to spend again to more forward I know where the delete button is for this app
US	5	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Mary DeStefano	Addicted for Certain!	I absolutely love the Dragon Mania Legends game! :D I am totally addicted! I love the dragons, they are so cute!

US	1	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Psin007	Greedy developer	The update increase the cost of everything important to the game.  There was a lot of backlash yet they wouldn't listen.  They are greedy.  They made everything harder so players would pay money.  Look away and avoid Gameloft.

US	5	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Prime Minister Montezuma X	Best dragon game to date.	The graphics are pretty and blend well into the fantasy world. The interaction with the dragons is really neat and something other games should have. And the battle system is one of the best immersive systems I have ever played on the iPhone. Truly, A masterpiece.

US	5	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Vvangrod	Addictive	Super fun and addictive. Much better than any of the other similar dragon games out there.
US	2	2015-03-13	1.1.0	King Amokof	Sad	Hai this is so unfair I worked hard till level 15 ok and it's not easy as it looks... The new update changes everything cuz my device version is 6.0 and I ain't want to lose every data for 6.1.6 version... I'm really sad if these updates continue like this.. PLZ STOP CHANGING EVERYTHING
US	5	2015-03-13	1.1.0	JollyRoger91	Great game	Compared to the other games of this genre, there isn't any comparison. I don't mind spending a little money on this game as it goes a long way. You don't really have to spend anything really.  Pet the dragons, and play the arena and you get free gems and energy as well as gold.  The energy recharges for free over time.  I really enjoy this title.  Great job!
US	3	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Spikensalem	New update increases difficulty threefold	I understand making the game more challenging at the higher levels, but the new update has also made the game TOO hard and too expensive at the lower levels. I'm not happy with it at all and I'm not sure I will continue to play. I had been enjoying it with my SO, but now we are both frustrated with the inability to earn scrolls except in very limited circumstances and the excruciatingly expensive requirements to use them. Do not appreciate that at all.
US	3	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Abracadu	Clan fortress and Others....	The game is awesome I love the graphics, dragons, and story line. I do have some concerns with the recent update. Like go instants the training of the dragons in the dragon academy is too expensive. And the food is very little compared to how much it is to level up a dragon. The chronos thing is awesome but I am also waiting for the clan fortress to open, if there is any chances that it could open more sooner I will give this game a 3 stars and I won't give it a 5 star rating till the dragon academy becomes cheaper again. :/
US	2	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Nikalofosho	Update ruined this game	This game was amazing AND THEN they updated it. The goals (like leveling up etc.) used to feel achievable.  Therefore, I didn't mind waiting 12 hours to hatch an egg or grow food. However, the update raised the prices and extended wait times. In some areas it even DOUBLED! I was willing to spend real money on this game because progress was attainable, but now it feels like a waste of time and effort. I'm very sad because I'm not an App game junkie. It takes a lot for me to get hooked. Well Dragonmania you had me but lost me. I even told friends that I had suggested this game to to forget about downloading it. Your game will be deleted from my phone:( it's bitter sweet because I once loved you so much!
US	5	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Hana5963	Great Game!	I like this game alot! Its very much like Dragonvale but has the battling that sets it apart. There are also a few different dragons and dragon types such as the vortex types. Its very creative and you can see where the creator got his or her inspiration. You can give your dragons different powers. There are events too! Overall, this game is great. I have no complaints.
US	2	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Mars1821	A super fun idea, but too many problems still.	I have had so much fun playing this game, especially before the recent update, but now it's hard to want to play after the large number of technical issues I have had happen to my account, a whole weeks worth of progress was erased from my game 3 separate times, causing me to loose a costly amount of stuff and set me far back behind other players. I also wrote several (at least 6) polite and descriptive letters to the customer service but they never got back to me. The game has also had server issues locking many users including myself out of the game for many days, and when I finally got back in the game, even more progress was missing. If your now behind like me or just starting to play now you won't have a chance at competing or completing the parts of the game that used to make it fun and addictive. It may still be fun to spend a small amount of time dinking around with the app, but you won't make it far enough now to spend much time. The game was originally very fun, and I hope they make restorative changes soon because it was well done and fun, but for now I assure you it's not a game to spend any money on at least because chances are you will lose what you spend with all the technical problems. Even when not locked out of the game, I deal with a technical issue of some sort every time I play. I still play a small bit, but I no longer try hard or have any expectations from this game. It's too bad.
US	4	2015-03-13	1.1.0	WeštaC	Great Game	It's a great game if you enjoy playing it slow because you can't or don't want to spend money for gems, you will never win great rewards when you participate if you don't pay and purchase gems, only last prize, but game is very addictive and have very nice graphics and most important, great gameplay... Very good dragon combat system... Lots of beautiful dragons and awesome animations... I repeat it's playable if you don't want to spend money, but it's very slow progress, for me personally, i still play it and enjoy it without paying anything. Final verdict 8/10
US	5	2015-03-13	1.1.0	Teewolf2	Love the game but	Love the game but the issues I am having is when I try to log into Facebook to get the prairie dragon it does nothing just keeps going back to that screen. Also I want to be able to add my friends who play and be able to see how they are doing and not just Toby. Then I will give my rating a five star.

US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	GQ4532	Very entertaining	This app provides a lot of fun. Lots of challenges and battles plus strategy for breeding dragons.
US	2	2015-03-12	1.1.0	LiviaZita	Horrible horrible update	"DML just released their first update to the game, and it ruined it for me.
You pay twice as much (sometimes more than twice the amount) for things like habitat upgrades, leveling and skill training your dragons, etc.
I had a hard time gathering enough gold for things, now I can forget about it. I guess I will stick to breeding dragons, the only good bit left to play. The rest just got ridiculous. Never ind paying for any gems now. Ha!"
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	DjvMjr	Addicting	Awesome game
US	2	2015-03-12	1.1.0	TheRealDirtyDan	Bad update	I like that there's more they can add to the game but they just made everything more expensive, like it takes more scrolls to upgrade, it takes longer to explore, eggs are taking longer to hatch I don't like it.  I get it, you want me to spend money to buy stuff but I'm already spending enough money as it is.. I don't want to spend more, if they don't fix it, I'm going to delete this app
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	1039384756alyb	Awesome	This game is pretty sweet. I wish though,they would make it so there are aspects of the game that do not require you to be online or use data to play
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Abo fahkdkd	Good	Great
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	daleo	Awesome fun play.	"This game beats Dragon Story 800 times over. It has a lot more gameplay to offer and there is constantly tournaments going on along with the raising of the dragons and increasing their attack powers. Then there's the battling against the game and against other players. 
Love this game!"
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Sbbeckma	I like it	Smart planning = big rewards
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Tyty is the guy	Best and Most Addicting Game in the World	It's just a fun and a game you can not put down so you should get it if you haven't already.
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Slphillips	Excellent Game	As far as dragon games go... You will not find a better game.  A little money will help you move quicker, but with a little patience, you can still do anything you would like.  I highly recommend this game!
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Solracdr	Great Game	Amongst all of the other Dragon breeding games, this one is definitely the most unique.
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	EclipseShadowfell	Fun	Easy to use and quite enjoyable.  Like the fact you fight vikings
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Tourny	Fun!	This game is very fun. There's no pressure to buy in app purchases and if you choose to there's fair pricing, but again it's not pressing like a lot of other games. It's very engaging and there's plenty to do to keep you coming back. I'm very happy I downloaded this game!
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	awaltermire	Love it!	Completely addictive
US	3	2015-03-12	1.1.0	EvilGopher	App crashes and resets progress	After the update, the app crashes and my progress resets every time I try to play.
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	JMVR	Great collaborative game	My 7 and 9 year old kids both share the same game.   It's great watching them negotiate what they are going to spend the coins on - food, building, or farming, and which dragons to train.
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Midluna	Amazing	I like how u can pat ur dragons an feed them

US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Janettenoir	Fun to play	This game is pretty cool I haven't seen any real big issues with the quality of it or the playability of it it's fun and pretty simple. I use this game as a way of relaxing or passing the time

US	2	2015-03-12	1.1.0	C0rlvr	Totally bummed with new version!	I am really upset with how much it cost to send your dragon to the school.

US	4	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Brony Dragon	GL account	Awesome game. Would rate 4.5/5 (but can't). My only complaint is that I can't use my Game Loft account. I mean, what's the point of getting the account for other games if it doesn't work here? Using the account would make finding friends a lot easier.

US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Ppppp138	Fun	"I think
They should work on the battle mechanics but the game is still really good. After I play a game for like 3 min I usually know if I'm keeping it."

US	1	2015-03-12	1.1.0	S-n-d	New update	I don't like how the new update requires more scrolls to teach dragons higher moves. It was already hard enough to get scrolls to do higher level moves. Now it will be almost impossible. The 20 day VIP should also cost less gems.

US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	A person that is awesome!!!	Fun to play	I love to play this game when I'm bored. Now with the new update I can't wait to unlock every island.
US	4	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Un-trimmed slayer	Dragon mania	Decent game, needs to have more evolutions with levels gained. Once you hit level 50 there is much left for you to do then grow food and breed dragons fun at first but now there is nothing left to level myself the game became pointless
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Rpgadddict	Best dragon game ever	I can tell, this game will be a lasting one. Great battle mechanics, great looking dragons, reasonable wait times. Whats missing is just the customizability. Im guessing future updates will bring it. But so far, this is the only game i have on my ipad. ;)
US	1	2015-03-12	1.1.0	wjackson324	WTH?!	"I for one absolutely HATE these new changes. This was just suppose to be a fun past time that yall have royally screwed up. You've gotten greedy and want people to put too much time into the game play. 

The prices of fundamental items in the game in increased too astronomical proportion and the payout (as far as I can tell) have not increased to compensate for that.  

I'll probably be putting my dragons on pause for a bit but thanks for the fun while it lasted..."
US	1	2015-03-12	1.1.0	PissedOffMamma	Crap!	Crappy update! Won't let us play unless I pay money now! Used to be a free fun game!! Not anymore! So bummed this is how it is now!!
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	WINXGIRL9	Awesome game	I really 💕💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💜 this game. I especially love my mud dragon hren. it is just adorbes u should buy it
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Tammybam6666	Awesome game! Update is great	"This game was already fantastic but now that there's an alternate ""heroic"" mode it's even better. This, coupled with the fact that you can now view how many portal gems you have, solidifies that this is my favorite game. Small improvements like that go a long way! Keep it up Gameloft!"
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Leejero	Fun game	Lots of fun playing the game.  My daughter loves the game.

US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Skeeter Master	Love game	I can't stop playing, I just wish the updates didn't include increasing prices
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Graceofheaven	Love it!	I would like to see a change to leveling up the dragons. Like when fighting them, they gain experience to help them level up, to cut the cost of food. Do to the number of dragons u have its hard to feed them all. But overall love this app.
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Knuckle head mc spasatron	Review	Awesome
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	the5ds	What I love about dragon mania legends	Love how you can pet you dragon friend. And battle to the end. I love all the cute, strong, silly, dragon. And I like that you can fight with friend in the arena.
US	4	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Peep1229	Love this game	I love this game. It's a lot of fun. The dragons are adorable. Wish I could rename my dragons and I think it takes too long for energy to refill with the versus its 40 mins which is ridiculous. But overall love it.
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Playwtrs	Awesome	Love it!
US	4	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Littlest four star	More to love?	"Now with the update, I have to download some additional data on my phone for a few dragons, since they are missing textures. This isn't supposed to really happen, I presume. It gets really annoying. I want to see my dragons!
Other than that, it's a pretty good game"
US	3	2015-03-12	1.1.0	BlueChaos827	New update issue	I noticed with the new update that if you click the information button for the cave on your main island the game immediately force closes. Not a game hindering bug, but should probably be fixed.
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Joe BigD	CRAZY ADDICTIVE	I never play mobile games ever but this game has taken over my life in a good way!! Best game EVER
US	2	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Wondergurlz	Good graphics but that is it	If you have $$$$ to spend, this game would be for you. This game starts manageable but as you level up and progress, the time and coins and food for dragons are needed proportionally more than you can gather from what the game allowed. and it shouldn't take more than 1 day to hatch any dragon.   Rip off.
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	TheStormCloud	Bart Baker Is The Reason I Got This	Awesome game... It really does get addicting after a while... My Favorite Dragon Is Storm Dragon ... But the only problem that's not really fair is if your a beginner at this game it's more than likely you won't win any of the limited event dragons... It's kind of annoying...
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	juniorj27	Cool game!!!!	Awesome graphics and very addictive game!!!
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Mr. Awesome!!	Addictive	Great game for when you're bored and when you're not! I find myself playing it all the time. Between breeding better dragons, leveling them up, fighting in battles on the campaign map and against other players, and all the other cool features, I'd say this is one of my favorite apps of all time.
US	4	2015-03-12	1.1.0	DelanoInferno15	A moderately slow start, but charming!	This game has been just adorable so far! It's rather disappointing someone with no money has to wait, but I love the interactive interface in battles and dragon care. You actually have to pay attention to your dragons and battles and not just collect and dash like other games. I feel like I'm taking care of something. It's nice!
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	QueenOrion	More than Expected!	I downloaded the game on a whim, hoping it would be a lot like Dragonvale (just less buggy), and what I actually got was a game that was far more interesting, creative dragons, and an actual experience. Among my other games on my phone, this has taken my all time favorite.
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Algaeeater	Battery drainer 😢	Amazing game. Addicting too. I even have a phoenix dragon from the first prize contest!  But this game drains my phone so fast that's it's almost impossible to play it without being on wifi :/. My brand new iPhone 6 can play clash of clans for like 20 mins and still be at 100. But just after 2 mins it drains to 85% on this game. Please fix
US	4	2015-03-12	1.1.0	becks0707	good game...	This is a great game, but it could be better (to me at least).  One way I can think of is that you can watch a few videos or ads and get energy for free instead of having to wait. I'd love it if you'd make a breeding a guide, but that would take away the point of arenas and stuff because people would know how to breed powerful dragons... maybe that wasn't a great idea. Anyways the app is great.
US	4	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Papabear414	Good game but had issues	This has been a fun and addicting game but there were things that I was confused on. The events, I didn't know you had to manually select to participate on. So I was unable to win some of the prizes they offered. And trying to get people in the friends list was also confusing. But after some communication with support, it was quickly resolved.
US	2	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Dee4j	Great game but...,	"Really fun game but everything is ""too expensive "" amount of food to feed dragons at higher levels is ridiculous, 50,000 food doesn't even level
Up one dragon. And cost 800,000 coins and 2 days to do that. Game is becoming frustrating because I can't get anywhere. Leveling up dragons and temples . Can't battle because until I level up all my temple ( void takes 1M coins) and all the dragons I'm encountering are level 22-24 and I'm stuck on 20... Because of this I'm certainly not going to spend real money because it's. A Rip-off."
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Drubio002	Dragon Mania Legends	This game is a lot of fun. There is a lot of entertainment here. You can breed dragons, compete with friends in battles, do endless quests for gold and gems, pet and feed your dragons and so much more.  The breeding is my favorite because there's so many possibilities! There are only two things that would make this game even better. I wish we could trade dragons among friends and that the breeding den could be upgraded to host more than one pair at a time. Otherwise, super awesome game.
US	3	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Shaun OTD	Game play and changes	I liked the game the way it was then the changed some things but it was still ok then I lost data and lots levels and time wrote a letter never herd back. Now they have radically changed the game making things more experience and harder after many other players have pass that point now we must suffer for the change where the others lots nothing. Now I'm having a hard time even wanting to play because I feel like 1 they don't care by not answering me message and 2 changing the game after others had the  benefit of cheaper stuff and the use of less scrolls to train dragons and now I must use more. So over all a once fun game is less fun after they keep changing things.
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Fufu70	Love this game	I like that you actually get to play and don't just tap a couple buttons and wait for timers.
US	4	2015-03-12	1.1.0	ActonMamaHolly	Cute game lots to do	I went on this game because of my son and was highly amused. The colors are bright and cheery. The dragons are cute and slightly interactive. Good game for children.
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Vlathos	Fantastic game, wish it minimized.	"This game is great. There's lots to do and it's not constantly pushing you to spend money. There's plenty to do without spending a dime. It's nice to be able to play with friends too. I love the breeding feature as well, it adds an interesting ""chance"" sort of element to the game. The only thing I'd change about the game is that it can't minimize. Just about every time you lock your screen, and every single time you minimize the app, it restarts when it is reopened. If you could minimize it and say, answer a text or go on safari, and the come back to it without having to wait the 10-15 seconds for it to restart it would be a lot nicer. Great app guys, keep up the great work!"
US	5	2015-03-12	1.1.0	Dragon we	Interesting	Great game fun and addicting
US	4	2015-03-11	1.0.2	Chris swagg	Good game	I love this game man make more they may be better but now this one is great
US	1	2015-03-11	1.0.2	Cri5252	This app will steal your money!!	"I played this game every day for a month. At first it was enjoyable and I had no issues, so I bought $5 worth of gems and became a ""VIP."" Still no issues. It started to become a grind, but that's to be expected with these games. My problem came when my ""VIP"" status ran out, and I went to buy $2 worth of more gems in order to renew it. The transaction went through and my VIP status renewed, leaving me with 25 extra gems or so. When I closed the game and came back later....I had 0 gems and was no longer a VIP. I submitted a report to ""customer care"" but still haven't heard back from them. If you play, don't spend any money!"
US	5	2015-03-10	1.0.2	Alienmetal	Only one problem!	I really do love this game, it's fun as heck. It's addicting and all around enjoyable but please please please change the fact that we can't name the dragons. It's annoying and the usually have super dumb names......
US	5	2015-03-09	1.0.2	️Vanela	Best dragon game	It is so good the graphics are good and the dragons are sooooo cute. 👍 I can't explain how good it is. If you haven't tried this game you haven't lived life.
US	5	2015-03-09	1.0.2	Cxrissa	I love this game	I love this game so much I play literally all day everyday ❤️❤️❤️
US	2	2015-03-09	1.0.2	Love pink monster girl	Girls Rule	"Why are all the dragons ""male"" in this game? They all so far were called ""he"". They can breed anyway and that isn't possible without a female. The trainer also was described as a guy. I find that unfair to women. You still can't rename the dragons."
US	5	2015-03-09	1.0.2	Aurorans	$200 Purchase = Worth it.	I really wanted that fairy dragon in the game, and now I have it, a legendary habitat, and much more thanks to 200 dollars worth in purchases. I am loving the game, and playing 24/7, with some moderation. A truely underrated game.
US	4	2015-03-09	1.0.2	Lizbug😘😊💙💚	Dragon mania	Its so much fun but It wont let me use the dragon fury button when fighting and I keep losing due to that and it's so annoying.

US	5	2015-03-07	1.0.2	Lilguys	Super cute dragons!!!	Tons of fun!  We like this a lot
US	5	2015-03-07	1.0.2	Glintscale	Best game EVAR!	"I love DML so much! Everything about it is awesome, from the detail in the dragons to the battling mechanics! I only ask for two things to be added to this game:

I would really like to be able to rename my dragons. Some have nice randomly generated names, but my Razor Dragon is named ""Clay"" and I'm pretty sure it doesn't fit the description of a sharp razor.

The other thing is that the friend system should be converted into the game, in addition or instead of trying to get Game Center or Facebook friends.

That's all I ask for, really. For now, I guess I can be satisfied with the friend system. If anyone wants to friend me, my Game Center is klfrr and I'm a level 25 VIP and I'm also a daily player."
US	4	2015-03-06	1.0.2	I want 1.2	WHY BUG WHY!!!!!!!!	"This game is great! I love it. But I just 
encountered a bug. I was playing, then I checked one of my other games, and when I came back, the came set me back about a half hour. I lost my 8 win streak, my boiling dragon's name changed because I had to re places it, the obsticals I removed where back, and the mystic cave explore canceled. PLEASE FIX THIS BUG"

US	5	2015-03-06	1.0.2	Bun_bunny_bun	Love	Love it
US	5	2015-03-06	1.0.2	Mirisda	Awesome game!	This game combines fun with dragons! You can battle other dragons, hatch legendary dragons,and just have fun. My only flaw is it should have a button saying if you played it or not so you don't have to read all of the directions again. Other than that, I love this game!
US	4	2015-03-06	1.0.2	Ra300	dragon mania faults	overall its a great game but there are some kinks that i would like to see changed first would be the invite friends system i hate the fact that i have too individual send an invite to everyone i would like to do it in like groups of like 30 or 50 for some of those who have alot of friends on facebook also and the only other fault i see wrong with the game is that you cant move your dragon academy i hate this because im OCD and i would like to move it somewhere where it fits if you guys could fix these two things you will make us a happy community.
US	5	2015-03-05	1.0.2	Fatman1206	This is awesome	I love this for my son tucker he's being more respectful to our dog missy, he now is feeding her and petting her and it's so sweet he's 6 now and my husband is so fun so they can play more then video games.

US	5	2015-03-04	1.0.2	Zombeegyrl	The BEST dragon game of all time!	Like any other geek, I'm addicted to dragons. I've played several other dragon that don't COMPARED to DML! This game has hundreds of dragons and bizarre quests. I've never come to a part of this game where I'm confused or frustrated at the game! This game allows your mind to travel with your dragons and love them as if they were real! My friend and I share a dragon if it is a limited time breed and one of us didn't get it, and we feed them and train everyday. Thanks The people who made DML! After all the good things I've said there were no complaints or anything mean! This game is truly brilliant coding and amazing minds. One suggestion I have (and its been said in other reviews) is to name are dragons. Paff and Poth are my favorite dragons (Elemental and Agave) but have....interesting names. If in the next update we could name our dragons it would be a superduperawesomeness game!
US	5	2015-03-03	1.0.2	Malacrazy	Awasome	This game is great 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟five stars all day BRUH
US	5	2015-03-03	1.0.2	Rosie_cat	I love the game but it kinda gets boring	The game is really fun and all but after awhile it kind of gets boring but I'll still rate it five stars
US	5	2015-03-03	1.0.2	Ldhsnd	Awesome 🐉🐲	This game is better than dragon city cause this is awesome graphics are stunning 😋🎊🎉
US	3	2015-03-03	1.0.2	HockeyWada13	Love it but...	I got the game because my friend wanted to play against me. Turns out we can because I have an iPhone and he has a Samsung. Every other game had figured it out why cant this one? But I don't love the game it's fun and addicting.
US	5	2015-03-02	1.0.2	Ggffdvv	Wfxddx	Awesome
US	5	2015-03-02	1.0.2	ToxicSavage23	This game is awesome	I like when u buy a new dragon it looks so adorable when the egg cracks
US	4	2015-03-02	1.0.2	Jacobmypetlizard	🔊🔊🔊🔊😱😂	I love this game it's great! Blah blah blah, but the notifications are SO LOUD even when it's on the lowest ringer level. Can u please fix this. Anyways I would like if I could chose to throw the egg away before I put it in the hatchery because that takes up a lot of time if I already know what type of dragon it is.
US	5	2015-03-02	1.0.2	Maya5506	Bart baker even loves the game	It is so good that I was watching a behind the scenes with Bart baker and he was playing it when he was taking a break

US	3	2015-03-01	1.0.2	Will.Jack	Great game. Grossly overpriced dragons	The game itself is so much fun to play; however, the prices they try to charge for dragons makes me want to stop playing. Dragons can cost 50-100$ a piece. Seriously??!!
US	5	2015-03-01	1.0.2	Burgy1323	Bart baker	Please send me the iPad!
US	5	2015-03-01	1.0.2	Workmangirl28	Awesome	One day I was just looking at apps and I came across this one. So I downloaded it. But I thought I wouldn't like it but I did and I'm really successful on it. If you are looking for virtual dragon pets than this is your game. Love it!! 🎮
US	5	2015-03-01	1.0.2	Awkward Umbreon	The best dragon game of 2015-2016	This is the best dragon game I've ever seen. They just took dragon apps to the next level. And if you haven't gotten the game yet... Then you totally should. Just saying...
US	5	2015-03-01	1.0.2	AAcutie	I really like it😄👍	Fun so much fun I like it a lot but when I breed my dragons I don't get any rare ones and it costs so many gems to speed things up but don't let me turn you away from this game because you would miss out
US	5	2015-02-28	1.0.2	Cutiepiepigys	Best game ever	Dragon mania is a super fun game.
US	5	2015-02-28	1.0.2	Kagocha	Review	This game is enjoyable for everyone. Little kids would love it along with adults. It teaches well i dont really know but its a fun game!
US	4	2015-02-28	1.0.2	aph-Germany	Great, but give us the choice to name!	"I really like this game. It's well done, and keeping me more entertained than many of the other ""city-builder"" and ""level-up-your-animal"" types of games. However, I really wish there was an option to rename the dragons or at least the choice to pick out one. This might sound silly, but I feel more detached from my cute little dragons because they all have really dumb default names. I would feel more like I own the dragons if I named them myself."
US	5	2015-02-28	1.0.2	Ninnyboy	Awsome game	People need to be able to get one legendary easier tho!
US	5	2015-02-28	1.0.2	Gwarrior82	Slightly addicted! And I thought Candy Crush was bad!	My little sister got me to try this and curiosity got the better of me and now I can't seem to put it down! I love finding out what different dragons I can breed, and all the nifty little features, it's like a crazy interesting mix of street fighter/tamagotchi/sim city. I love it! But seriously I'm 32 years old! I should really just delete it. But I'm waiting to see what my first water dragon breed turns into.

US	3	2015-02-23	1.0.2	Yafavoriteperson	Almost perfect	I love the game and I am addicted to it. But I have one major problem I keep running into. It keeps reloading the game when I'm playing and what it calls dusting the maps. I was playing two players matches online and got kicked out of each match before I can finish because it reloaded the game and dusted the maps. I don't think it counted as a loss but it did take an energy away every time and now I have to wait half an hour to play again because of a problem the game is causing.

US	5	2015-02-22	1.0.2	Momotality	How many people are here because of Bart Baker	Bart Baker said he would give a free iPad to someone who downloads this game, I wonder how many people (other than me) have done it for that reason.
US	5	2015-02-22	1.0.2	Kick my but LOL	The best game ever	Nothing to say, just play!!!
US	3	2015-02-22	1.0.2	DDD84	Expensive dragons	This is a great game to play. The dragons are cute but are just too expensive. It takes forever just to save up enough dragon cash to buy a dragon and even a habitat. It's also too expensive to upgrade a habitat and to plant food and have dragons explore a cave and pirate ship. These dragons can only dish out so much dragon cash thru habitat collecting and by petting them. You need to lower the prices on the dragons and habitats. Oh and give us an option into renaming the dragons and move them habitat to habitat. That's totally unfair. Anyways I had to delete the game cuz it's just too expensive. Please lower the cost of dragons.
US	5	2015-02-21	1.0.2	Smurumtious	👍	👍😄😃😀😊😜
US	3	2015-02-21	1.0.2	Donner11	Bad	I honestly love this game but now it continuously takes me off a battle that I'm barely winning and it needs so much Wi-Fi to function correctly. It's just ridiculous!! 😡😡😔👺

US	5	2015-02-21	1.0.2	😈thecritic	Great game	I love this tycoon so much better then any other I've played
US	5	2015-02-21	1.0.2	MyriadThings	Absolutely Best Dragon Breeding Game!	All of the characters are absolutely adorable (I've seen a lot dragon breeding games with some pretty ugly dragons). Everything is so smooth and beautiful. You can pet your dragons and hand feed them (which has made me very attached to my dragons) and battle them (unlike some dragon breeding games who's only  goal was to collect all the dragons). Over all this game is my favorite dragon breeding game and I've seen them ALL.

US	4	2015-02-19	1.0.2	Abigail Randazzo	Amazing but...	This app is incredible but there are a few things I would like to change. When you get your dragon you do not get to name them and there are a few names that did not fit my dragons :(. So, I am just saying that it is a virtual dragon game and we should feel free to name them. Also I don't like that most things in the store cost so many gems and you have to go buying more gems and waste your real money that you could get music, apps, movies and your favorite episode of your favorite show! Don't get me wrong this game is great!
US	5	2015-02-18	1.0.2	Dhdheveixjxbdgs1829393	Love it	This is a fun game
US	4	2015-02-18	1.0.2	GratefulG@l	Really fun game!	I love this game! It's a lot of fun how you can buy habitats and attract more dragons to it. One thing though, it is a little annoying that you cannot name your dragons.They are already named. But otherwise, I love this  game and I definitely recommend it.😊
US	5	2015-02-18	1.0.2	tinkeerbell	Carolann Prutch	This is an amazing game. I play 3 other dragon games and this one is nothing like it.
US	5	2015-02-18	1.0.2	Yourtreasure	Awesome	Best dragon game ever!
US	5	2015-02-17	1.0.2	King WizKid	Cool	It's awesome
US	2	2015-02-17	1.0.2	Bomb eater	Good game but not good enough	Good game in many ways. But gating parts of game until I have X number of friends, given Facebook must be used is unacceptable.  I cannot invest in this game until that is fixed and there are other good suggestions on the forums. And better support. When I see updates in these directions then I will feel developer serious about this game for long term.

US	4	2015-02-17	1.0.2	Jayrosh	Dragon	This is currently my favorite game on the App Store the only thing I don't like is that it tells you how to breed a dragon and even if you do it exactly how they tell you you still might not get that dragon

US	4	2015-02-16	1.0.2	EnderKrystal	Good game but really???	This is a fun game and all, but there is a problem that kinda ruins the game for me. The names are very VERY dopey and since you want to make us remember that, you don't put an option to rename your dragons. PLEASE READ THIS because I don't think anybody wants their dragons being ruined by dumb names like Felix or Rake, and yes apparently I have to have a salamander dragon named after a gardening tool. Heck, I even have a very rare dragon named Mali. I think thats in another language. By the way, Dragonvale and Dragon city got down the renaming thing pretty well so why not you?
US	4	2015-02-15	1.0.2	Zdmire	Really good game!	This game is amazing and very much like DragonVale and Dragon City- which are also good games. This game is really fun to play with a whole lot of fun features. The only downsides I can think of are that to finish breeding or construction early you must spend a bunch of gems and. That you can't name dragons once their hatched- the name the game gives them is their permanent name.

US	3	2015-02-15	1.0.2	Pooocat	Food gone	Game was fun, somehow I lost over 10000 in food. Opened game and had 1.
US	4	2015-02-15	1.0.2	Antoy711	Surprisingly Fun!	I originally downloaded this for my first grader. After having to help her a few times I was hooked.  I had never been into games like this before. The battles are fun and I love that you can breed and level up your dragons. The only downside is the increased wait time. Great job with the game!
US	5	2015-02-15	1.0.2	😵💀💀💀💀💀	😛😎😆👍	This game is cool.
US	3	2015-02-14	1.0.2	Ninjaderp9877	No cross platform	Really wish this game worked across platforms because I know someone that plays on a windows phone and I'm on iOS. Good game though

US	5	2015-02-13	1.0.2	Mikelmisa	Great game	Good game,very interesting. Only one question..why ppl who also play dlm are invisible in friends list and how can i add them? P.s. Perfect gg
US	4	2015-02-13	1.0.2	Lolo the fuzzy	Good but it needs fixing	Laggy, crashes in the middle of the battles .you should add more dragons to the selection of breeding eggs.
US	5	2015-02-13	1.0.2	Yoloman6969	Love it	Love it
US	5	2015-02-13	1.0.2	Midnight crow	DML	Best dragon game from App Store yet
US	4	2015-02-13	1.0.2	KeySeeker13423	Wifi issue	This game is really great and I love it! But even though my iPod is still strongly connected to the wifi, the game keeps refreshing itself as though it had disconnected. Please fix this soon as it's making it harder to progress
US	5	2015-02-13	1.0.2	Emeebird	Stunning and Hilarious	The graphics are amazing. The dragons make hilariously adorable facial expressions and it's highly interactive. Each dragon seems to have its own personality and it's easy to breed to get rare dragons. Yeah, to farm food and upgrade and buy habitats and whatnot are a little expensive, but that's why you save and save and save. The gold cap for each habitat reaches limit very fast so you can eventually get what you need. Very cute game and addicting.
US	5	2015-02-12	1.0.2	Cod heroes fan	The cool game	Awesome 😊
US	5	2015-02-12	1.0.2	Emi247	ADDICTING!!!	I'm stupid addicted to this game. Could play it all day long if I had the time.

US	5	2015-02-12	1.0.2	CoolcatDiva90	Way better than dragon city!	This is the best dragon game ever made. I got dragon city first but then I got really bored. This game,you can actually feed and pet your dragons! I'm amazed how awesome this game is!
US	5	2015-02-11	1.0.2	Jrmarlowe	GAMER	I love this game I am so into dragons can you make more like this please I will try to find and play it
US	5	2015-02-05	1.0.2	46bae	BEST GAME EVER!!!😃😃😃	Needs to let you pick your dragons names and the rest of the app is amazing my sister and I love this game and play it almost all day and still never gets old can't say how much I love this game and it's the BEST game ever and so addicting can not stop playing it my friend even thinks it is the best game ever😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 I think that everyone should get and enjoy this app if they have enough space on their phone and as a bonus it is FREE!!! What can get better than that
US	5	2015-02-03	1.0.2	😄😃😀😊☺😉😍y	Coool!!!	"It's so awesome cause you have different dragons and elements and stuff like that I have had no problems with it I was changing working well you should buy it really you should buy it! So buy it please when I have 10 I would give this game at 10.9 because the company is the best inability should buy it please please please please 😺😸😄😃😀
please please buy it"
US	5	2015-02-02	1.0.2	T L0v3	Great game but	Sometimes when selecting to battle, it freezes right when thee Dragons are shown. All the user can do is retreat from the battle at which the user loses the energy used for that battle. Tapping on the screen or pausing the battle does not help the battle get fully started. Please fix as soon as possible.
US	5	2015-02-02	1.0.2	Peter 138	Amazing game	I love games like this, breeding different elemental creatures and getting new hybrids, along with the breeding and incubating times. This one is one of my favorites. The battling is a nice touch and the graphics are very nice. My one problem is whenever I place a structure or habitat I can't move it. This can get very annoying sometimes.
US	5	2015-01-31	1.0.2	YoUr wOrSt dIgItAl nIgHtMaRe	DRAGON MANIA ROXXXXXX	This is by far the greatest dragon game. Much more exciting than 'Dragon Tales' for PS2. Better than FarmVille!!
US	5	2015-01-31	1.0.2	Ashiroon	One problem	This is an excellent game, however there is one problem. On other games, when you want to speed something up, it's pretty reasonable priced. However, this game charges you 15 gems to speed up something that takes half an hour. 15 gems! That's a ripoff! Other than that this is an excellent game.
US	4	2015-01-30	1.0.2	Liza Beann	Fun, but I'm frustrated.	I really like this game. It's cute, it's fun, it's interactive - but I am really frustrated about the crashing bug. During battles it crashes all. The. Time. Then, after it crashes, I'm still down one patiently-waited for energy for battling EVEN THOUGH I didn't even get to attempt to finish the battle. It basically force retreats me, even when I have a strong connection to wifi. That's my only complaint.
US	5	2015-01-29	1.0.2	King_of_Epicnes 👑	"Best ""Dragon"" Game on the App Store! 🐲"	"Dragon Mania Legends is not just your average dragon ""feeding, breeding and fighting"" game! DML has become a daily thing that I check every single day. It is fun, interactive, enjoyable, competitive and all around an amazing game to download! First of all, the graphics are detailed and colorful! Like I mentioned before, DML is a very interactive game. You can pet your dragons, you can open their egg when they are hatching, you can time your attacks in battle and you can literally feed your dragon food! I do enjoy the different event that go on where you can win prizes and even dragon eggs! My only request is that there should be a trading system. You would be able to trade with friends from Facebook or Gamecenter, or use Bluetooth! All and all, this has become one of my favorite games that I highly recommend you download! 👍"
US	5	2015-01-29	1.0.2	Hhhjdxg	The best game ever	I've played a lot of games like this dragon city dragon vale monster legends and more and when my brother said he found a new game like those other ones I thought I wouldn't  like it but I tried it any ways and loved it but I wish you didn't         have to use energy when you fight
US	4	2015-01-27	1.0.2	BO2 assassins creed guy	Awesome but...	"This is one of the best games I have ever played. Although I have a REALLY annoying bug to report. Two of my high level farms will show that I have food ready to take. When I press on them. I get nothing and it says something like ""you have lost connection to the game"" or something. Every time I press it it still does that. Please patch this bug so I can happily continue with this game."
US	4	2015-01-26	1.0.2	Person 2.0	Needs a tad bit more	This is definitely my favorite dragon game out of all those others like Dragonvale. However, a few things could make it a lot better. For example decorations. My islands just look kinda dull with just farms and habitats, decorations would make the game much more visually appealing than it already is. But I'm looking forward to the whole clan thing.
US	4	2015-01-25	1.0.2	SoulsStorm	Fun game. Certain glitches are annoying.	"Overall, it's a good game I recommend getting. I wish dragons had at least one more growth stage though. Very similar to Clash of Clans in play style. 

That being said, I keep running into a glitch that makes attack moves unavailable in battle but consumes energy (what's used to initiate attacks) either way.

Also, unless I'm missing it there's no edit mode for moving around buildings. With the large amount you end up dealing with, organizing your islands becomes a rather daunting task."
US	2	2015-01-24	1.0.2	Pandadear	Unhelpful Support	"This is a great and fun game, but I would suggest not making any in-app purchases. Upon making a purchase, I was dropped from the server. The money was taken and my items I bought were gone. Support is nearly impossible to get hold of and unhelpful and unresponsive when you finally do. I've been battling this for over a week and still nothing. My well-earned money gone to cyberspace.

Otherwise, a very fun game despite its glitches, though this stressful situation makes it much less enjoyable for me, personally."
US	4	2015-01-24	1.0.2	Jahjitsu	I normally do not play games likes	"Like the title says, I've played games that are similar, gameplay wise, to this game. For some reason though I am still playing it and am having a great time. I've actually spent money on the game (about $7) and don't regret it at all. The arena system is fun (doesn't seem like there are hackers that have over the top scores), the battle system is fun, just everything about the game has a nice charm to it. There is a VIP system that you get for 7 days from your first purchase of gems, but after that you need to buy the status. Also, currently I am number 1 in arena :)

There are a few cons about the game:

-energy you only have 3 (5 with VIP) arena you only have 4 (6 if you're a VIP I believe I don't remember). It's not TOO irritating but some battles in story mode are challenging and your energy spending is useless.

-waiting for a guild system to be implemented. Honestly I can't wait for this and am looking forward to starting my own.

All in all its a great time management game."
US	5	2015-01-22	1.0.2	BaDiBa	Fun. Decorations, please?	"I'm really liking this game; no major complaints. The flow is smooth and fairly fast paced, and I like that you have several challenges on your ""to-do"" list to keep you busy. I would just like to suggest that there should be a ""Decorations"" menu added. Once you remove all of the ""obstacles"" (trees, etc), the islands look pretty barren. Other than that, great job!"
US	4	2015-01-22	1.0.2	Jhfthb	The new	I'm so excited
US	4	2015-01-22	1.0.2	Buck04	And so on	Cool so far

US	5	2015-01-21	1.0.2	Pistachio cat77482	Awesome and cool😎	I love how exciting and addicting this game is.IT RULES believe me!!!!!!!
US	5	2015-01-21	1.0.2	Pariz16	Suggestion for the Breeding and Hatching	I would like an option to cancel a breeding and hatching because it's taking a long time before to breed again like you changed your mind. Please make an option, not all have enough gems to always skip the time. But I love the game, so entertaining better than any Dragon Games even Dragon City.
US	4	2015-01-21	1.0.2	Sebby42	Good but	The game is really good but if the dragons.          By.               Had more stages of evolution I would         B.                           Perrfer it more

US	5	2015-01-21	1.0.2	BLBerger	Great	I love the game. The wait times are reasonable and the design is nice. I did have one issue with a purchase, but I contacted the game developers and they gladly helped me fix the problem.
US	5	2015-01-21	1.0.2	Tootoot	Great	So many things to do, so many dragons to breed and a beautiful style make this a great game.
US	5	2015-01-21	1.0.2	Ooooggoorr	Awesome	This is a pretty awesome game
US	5	2015-01-20	1.0.2	Figgada	Super fun!!!	Amazing game!
US	5	2015-01-20	1.0.2	OECDlapushfan101	WAY better than Dragonvale!!!	LOVE this game! It reminds me very much of Dragonvale, but with much better graphics, gameplay, and waiting times. I love the dragon designs, and the battle feature which poses challenging, but fair, fights against evil Vikings. I really enjoy being able to compete against other player's dragons as well in the battle arena and participating in event challenges - which will sometimes award awesome exclusive dragons! I definitely recommend this app to all dragon lovers and those who enjoy DragonVale, Dragon City, Dragon Story, etc. I think this one tops them all!!
US	5	2015-01-20	1.0.2	Dragon 😍	Love it	I love it so much! I actually wish i was in it i love my dragons! And i want to beat the vighkings

US	5	2015-01-20	1.0.2	King kingdom	gude	ok
US	4	2015-01-19	1.0.2	Lupusperangelespennae	There is Actually a little game play to this one	"Very Collect them all based. But has a solid game play style with good combat mechanics and a decent breeding system. Game is very much possible without spending money with out being completely unfair, but still worth at least $5-$10 as the older generation would have spent on a game. 

-1 Stars because of the lack of a lot of social interaction, don't want to add bunch of complete strangers to my face book to do things in this game.
As a slight annoyance managed to breed a legendary dragon, and so far he's kinda a let down in combat."
US	5	2015-01-19	1.0.2	LegendaryFlame	Perfect for dragon fanatics	Iv played every dragon training game out so far and not one of them had this much detail or interactivity it has so much potential updates are going to be off the chain can't wait to see what new species they come up with for us to breed but there's one problem a lot of people can't add there friends or vist there islands
US	5	2015-01-18	1.0.1	spheller	Very addicting!	This game is my favorite!  💙 it!
US	5	2015-01-18	1.0.1	Gddddudjd	What a great game!!	I really love this game.

US	5	2015-01-17	1.0.1	Zaylabear	The Best of it's Genre	I absolutely LOVE this app, if you enjoy breeding games you'll be very impressed with the variety of dragons and gameplay that comes with this app. This is one of the few free to play apps that aren't over-bearingly pay to win.
US	5	2015-01-17	1.0.1	$Frenzyy1231$	Pretty clean game. Highly recommend it	Title says it all
US	5	2015-01-17	1.0.1	Giannina1212	Amazing !	Love this game
US	5	2015-01-17	1.0.1	Joke an	Dragon mania	well it's about time thy put this on the I pad looks and plays better than Galaxy version
US	4	2015-01-17	1.0.1	Popsicat	Awesome game!	I love absolutely love this game! I love being able to interact with your dragons, and I love the battle system. I just wish you can name your dragons. It creates a greater bond with the dragons, and I just can't get used to having a dragon named Joke. Another issue is the friending system, because most of my friends don't have a Facebook, and I really want to add them. Other than that, great game!
US	5	2015-01-17	1.0.1	Mikeymike11111	Best of the Dragon Games!	"I have played Dragonvale and Dragon City, and each have their charms and fun things to do, but this one is gripping right away, and if they develop it properly and listen to the players it will surely become the king of the dragon games.

The ONLY gripe I have so far is that friend lists are Facebook only. I'll be lonely until they change that, as I won't add friends just to play a game.

Great job so far though!"
US	4	2015-01-16	1.0.1	PseudoUnlimited	Needs A Little Work	"I love this game, but I have a few problems.

1. NAMING

I want to be able to name my dragons! I don't want to walk around saying, ""Hey peeps, check out my rad Fire Dragon! Yep his name is Alex, pretty cool right?""

To be quite honest, I don't want to name him Alex. Nor do I want a graceful serpentine wind dragon to be named HOBART. If you could just name the dragons, that would be great. But otherwise, this game is great.

2. MOVING STUFF

I don't want to have all my habitats stuck in the same place for eternity. Shouldn't we be allowed to rearrange?!

3. BREEDING

This is a serious issue. Sure, a dragon can be uncommon, but SERIOUSLY?! You should make it so that breeding a dragon has a different outcome if you rearrange the order the parents are bred in. Well, I tried this like six times, and it did not work. Fix the breeding!"
US	4	2015-01-15	1.0.1	Kardelune	Bug	"Overall great game, I haven't had this much fun with a virtual pet game in a while. The variety of dragons is amazing, and so far there's the right balance between paying to play and just playing.
I'd just like to mention: on those missions where you're asked to use a particular type of dragon to fight i passed by fighting against those types rather than with those types (happened with water and plant type dragons)"
US	4	2015-01-15	1.0.1	BareFootTrucker	Love it a lot	"This game is so cute and fun.  There is so much more to do than in any other dragon game out there.  The combat system takes a little skill and luck which I enjoy more than just a dice roll.

The things that need improvement are the social system.  Any game that relies strictly on Facebook  for friends is severely crippled socially.  Myself, like many others, don't want to add strangers to our Facebook  friends just for games and, or our friends don't play the game, have ipad etc. Apple has a perfectly functional  Game Center that most other games have no problem with, so it should be made functional here ASAP.

Next comes the complete lack of decoration.  You have to dig up all the cute trees and bushes etc in order to place you habitat and then can't put anything back to dress it up again.  That makes me sad because those things I dug up are cute and I would like to be able to place them where I want to.

There are a few other minor issues that others have touched on so I won't go over them again.  Over all though this game gets 4 stars for potential and depth.  I may drop it to three if these things aren't improved in a reasonable time table though."
US	5	2015-01-14	1.0.1	Brennaboo100	Good love it!	I love this App it's amazing. But it crashes and says ,'' you have been disconnected from the server.'' Plus I was on a boss and I beat it and it said the you have been disconnected thing and I lost my progress all my energy (because I used it up for the boss) and same with the hiring other peoples dragons . Other wise  this app is amazing I strongly recommend it to others..
US	3	2015-01-14	1.0.1	NoTaSpEnDeR	A Lazy Masterpiece	This game is charming, and the graphics are the best of any park-building game I've played before. However, the dragons have the same four body types over and over; the fire and smoke dragons look and act nearly identically. I haven't been playing long, but I think that not all dragons are breed able, and only obtainable as prizes. There are also not yet any decorations, so my park looks as interesting as a cardboard box.
US	5	2015-01-12	1.0.1	Sabs555	Great Game	I am very impressed with this game, the only thing i would change would make it easier to add friends you meet in game verse having to use Facebook, and make the arena rounds for a single day not 6 days
US	1	2015-01-12	1.0.1	BeastyPrincess	2 days?!	Really! 2 stupid days to hatch a egg?! Wow...1 star.
US	5	2015-01-12	1.0.1	Selective_Hawk	Cute game	I like the graphics it's cute I'm just not willing to pay money for it

US	5	2015-01-12	1.0.1	NoobNugget247	Dragons ftw	This game brings a new twist to the typical dragon breeding game. I love the use of the training, and all the animations and sounds. The fact that all the dragons have sweet as animations really helps draw me in. I can never wait to see what I just breeded 👌
US	5	2015-01-12	1.0.1	Prince Brayan	AWSOME GAME	I am loving this game because the thing I like about it is that you actually get to pet,feed,train,and they live in there habitats
US	4	2015-01-12	1.0.1	¥killjoy¥	Great	This is a very good game ill give it 4 stars ****
US	2	2015-01-12	1.0.1	Renz Arbis	The Game has stopped working	YES. The game has stopped working. I was enjoying it until i reached level 13. When i go back to the game it either never finishes mapping dragolandia or it starts, i click on one habitat to harvest its gold and then the game freezes for eternity. Please help me, i really love the game
US	4	2015-01-12	1.0.1	ihelo	Very good game, some technical problems	I love the gameplay so far, it is a refreshing mix of many different games that I have enjoyed. Unfortunately the in-game store seems to be a bit broken. I bought the $2 starter pack but the gems, money, food and dragon disappeared before I could use them and I still haven't heard from the support staff.

US	5	2015-01-11	1.0.1	Dragon3125	This game is amazing!	This is a really detailed game and the battles are so fun and different from other games!

US	5	2015-01-11	1.0.1	Singerfide	Amazing	IT'S SO FUN, IT'S ADDICTIVE! I finally have a game I don't mind wasting time on. Although I do wish that time speed-ups weren't so expensive with gems. Other wise it's pretty cool. 👍👍
US	4	2015-01-11	1.0.1	Bcount1	Beautiful!	I've been looking for a good dragon game for a while. The others where too ugly for me, I really love the way this one looks.  It's a cash grab like most apps, if you don't pay up after a while you'll have to wait long 30 - 40mins. But so far I have not reached a part where I HAD to pay or I couldn't progress.
US	5	2015-01-11	1.0.1	TankWolf29756	Good Game	Good game. Better than Dragonvale and Dragon City in my opinion. Nice graphics too.

US	5	2015-01-11	1.0.1	R4k Smey	Good	Goof
US	5	2015-01-11	1.0.1	Frontiernet.net	Simply beautiful	This game is amazing. It is very fun and beautifully animated. It's is a great game to go on and a fair one.
US	5	2015-01-11	1.0.1	Lovesneakers234	Best dragon breeding and battling game yet	This game has solid graphics and actually interesting battles lots of cool dragons too and the wait time for dragons to breed and hatch isn't too long but I'd really like it if you could make the wait times shorter Aint nobody got time to wait for 7 hours for a common dragon to hatch! But other than that this game is AWESOME!
US	4	2015-01-11	1.0.1	Faythkittie	Cute but could improve	"There's a lot to like about this game. It's very interactive in that you actually get to pet, hatch, train, and feed the dragons using swiping motions rather than just button click everywhere. The motions the dragons do when you pet them are adorable.

The battle system is also fun, and requires a bit of timing and paying attention.

My only two complaints are the friend system and lack of directions. I really dislike when apps only have Facebook, not everybody has friends that play or wants to add complete strangers to their FB for the sake of an ipad game. An in-game friend system or even just one through gamecenter would be much better.

Also, the game would be more fun if we could buy decorations to personalize our island a bit more. Things such as paths, flower beds, fancy trees, ponds, rocks, fences, lights, flags, houses, etc. as it stands it's a bit plain with just habitats and farms, plus the obligatory breeding den and hatching nest.

Overall, it's a great game with nice graphics, great gameplay, and a cute story, but a better friend system and decorations would make it top notch."
US	5	2015-01-11	1.0.1	Mr. Hailee Malo	Dragons Rock! 🐲🐉✨	I am beyond impressed with this game! I usually play Fantasy Forest. This game surpasses it by a long run. I especially love the quality of the graphics and the battling. The graphics are amazing. The battle system is very clever and impressive. With a little understanding of each of the Dragon Skills and effectiveness I was ready and blasting my way through the levels. I even spent $1.99 on the starter bundle for a rare dragon, 100 gems, and 10,000 fruit. Way to go Dragon Mania! You've got yourself a dedicated gamer here.👍😃
US	5	2015-01-11	1.0.1	Five star ratings for real	Add in all dragons!!!	It's a AWESOME game but u have to download in over half the dragons!!! I ran out of space on my iPad! And also I was battling and I reached battle 8 and I couldn't do it unless I downloaded a dragon!!! Please make an update where all dragons are added in!!!!!!!! And btw this game is actually still really good it has GREAT graphics on my terms and is a worthy of five stars in my opinion.

US	5	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Shar958	SO GOOD	I've played lots of game with dragons, but this is the best. When I saw it in the App Store I thought it would be really dumb and I was surprised. It's the best.
US	2	2015-01-10	1.0.1	dingojcug	Freeze	I,love the game and all,but it freezes waynto ,much
US	3	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Bullovergirl	FUN, but...	The first time I went on, it crashed, second time worked perfect, third time, well, I'm still trying to get on a third time, it completely freezes. Please, I would give this app five stars, if this problem was fixed.
US	5	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Idgfuddhchdjcd	Love this game!!!!	I love this game! I've been looking for a dragon game for some time now and when this came out. I was so happy!!! I rate 5 stars for amazing 3D- like graphics and the fighting style. Just one thing though... I wish the wings would be bigger. The wings are so small it looks unrealistic. But overall I love this game!!!!
US	5	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Tehgdhd	Awsome	This game is so fun keep up the rewards and updates!
US	5	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Sammyboyyyy	Awesome	Liking it so far
US	5	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Blackchupito0427	Extremely Entertaining	I have played other dragon games and so far is pretty much like Dragonvale BUT with way better graphics, and the battle system is so much more fun than other games. Yes it has freemium stuff but if you have patience you dont need freemium currency or the VIP system, so far so good!!
US	5	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Theeanimalman	Perfect	Its a perfect game i love ir dont chance a thing
US	4	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Vbjvbhvghvgu	Amazing, but major glitch.	The game and everything about it is great, I've been playing non stop. Unfortunately it's come across a glitch where it won't let me claim my log in bonus, the button isn't pressable and the screen won't go away. I can still browse through each day's bonus, but that's literally it.
US	5	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Tezskdkri	Great	Great game! Just add a feature that we can rotate the whole thing. If you did that, game:  perfect!
US	5	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Pokemaster81	Awsome game	This is the best dragon game ever it has great graphics like others have said and its just great!!!! 😋😋
US	5	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Poohbeargotjams	Got some jams.	Rapmon says this games has some jams.
US	5	2015-01-10	1.0.1	DRAGON.M.L	DragonManiaLegends	This is automatically my favorite Dragon game and already in just 5 minutes of playing it, it may also be in my top 5 favorite games range. Thank you for making the game, it is really fun.P.S. Do you think there are any other games like this? Maybe, maybe not, but who cares when you have this game😃!!
US	5	2015-01-10	1.0.1	chameleon11	Excellent, but a minor concern	"I love this game, I've played DragonVale (has more dragons, but graphics aren't as good), and Dragon City (has fighting, but it's less like this form of battling). This one, I must admit, is the best one yet, the graphics are great, the battles are excellent (plus, I got a $2 bundle, so now I've got all of the gold and food I need, plus the rare tribal dragon, so that kinda pleases me).

But, I'm having a bit of a problem with the app, I can't get on, or when I do, it'll go to a screen with text about the server being unreachable with a green button that reads ""retry"". The thing is, my other internet games do work, without a problem, seriously, I wouldn't be writing this review then!

I'm just saying, and don't let this make you hesitate to download the app.

DOWNLOAD IT!!!"
US	4	2015-01-10	1.0.1	Jinzogod	Only slightly frustrating	The game itself is very well laid out. The wait times are not too freaking long like a lot of games, and the battles are actually interesting AND require a basic understanding and skill level. The graphics are very nice and the story is wtv, but then nobody cares about the story. The reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because finding friends is a HASSLE! It makes you ask for friends in facebook instead of being smart and using an in game friending system. It's not as good as brave frontier, but I've downloaded hundreds of app games and this is easily my number 2.

US	4	2015-01-09	1.0.1	Benaffect23	Great.	Reminds me of an app called dragons world but you actually get to choose which dragon to attack. I like the graphics and mechanics so far so good.
US	5	2015-01-09	1.0.1	Newton Brodie-Sangster	Very Fun	"I don't know why this game doesn't have any reviews... probably because the game just came out ^.^

But anyway, it's a very good game, and I recommend it. The graphics are amazing, and so are the sound effects. Though it acts like a typical freemium game (trying to coax ""gems"" out of you"" by making the wait times long), it's still enjoyable to play if you're patient. 

It's a lot better than other dragon games I've played; the ""fighting"" thing is a lot better, and so is the setup in general hehe

BASICALLY JUST GET IT OK"

US	5	2015-01-09	1.0.1	Poffy101	Fun but...	"This game has potential to be the best game ever! But all the dragons are alike! The poses!! Just have the dragons be in unique poses and colors instead of alike dragons with simple colors. Also there seems to be no decorations. This is what the game needs:
1. More dragons constantly
2. Decorations
3. Unique story about each of them 
4. Did I already say more dragons?

Other than that the games great, no glitches. Thanks"

Ok first.If you like Dragon Story you will be addicted to this game.This is better than that game.Also its easy to collect money and level up dragons.Take short time to breed and hatch dragons.But I think you should add leaderboards where you can visit top Dragon Islands.And the battle is so so exciting!

I've played other dragon games in the past, and this so far soars above them. I especially like the unique way battles work, it's pretty entertaining. I haven't played this game that much yet, but so far I've seen absolutely no flaws with it. Totally rating 5 stars for now, it's a must buy for people who like the dragon training games.
